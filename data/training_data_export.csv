In a nutshell, here is one reason why my party prefers full member status within the European Union to the present constitutional position. While the EU shows interest in cross-European co-operation and

"I certainly would, as I said earlier.

Angela Merkel is quoted in The Wall Street Journala few days ago as saying:

“As Chancellor of Germany, I should and sometimes must take risks but I cannot embark on an adventure.”

I cannot think of any more dangerous adventure than moving away from the rule of law and inviting the tendency to coercion, which is increasingly evident in German policy making. Indeed, I believe that new rules of law are being asserted to break the rule of law. I am sorry to say that in Germany they seem to believe in government by rule. We believe in government by consent.

The process will not work. We are now in the period of a phoney war. Those who have seen the play “Three Days in May”, about 1940, may well wonder whether it is now obvious that, if we were to acquiesce in imposing the new and unacceptable rules, and in using EU institutions, that would become a new process of appeasement. Fortunately for us, in those dark days, Churchill refused to accept Halifax’s advice at the end of that fateful month.",Moral Value
"There is a body of opinion in the EU that wants to make this country submit to the EU deficit procedure and we have, unfortunately, entered into some commitments on that. We must keep out of those commitments because they run completely counter to the principles of democracy both in the individual member states and in the EU. Under article 7—let us remember that this is not an EU treaty and is outside the EU—when the Commission is of the opinion that a country is in breach of the deficit procedure, it brings the matter before the other member states and unless there is a qualified majority vote against taking the decision that the commission wants to take, the matter must be treated as a breach and the offending country will be hauled before the European Court of Justice.

"The debate has touched on the process of ratification in other European Union member states. The majority of member states have approved the decision in accordance with their constitutional requirements. Most member states require parliamentary and then presidential or royal approval. Germany and the Czech Republic remain to complete their constitutional requirements. That is largely an administrative process. Both countries have to gain presidential sign-off for an agreement that has been taken through the appropriate parliamentary processes. Germany is waiting for a ruling by its constitutional court, which is due later this week.

There is a further stage once the national constitutional procedures have been completed, in that each national Government has formally to deposit the instruments of ratification in Rome. Poland and Italy, as well as Germany and the Czech Republic, have yet to deposit those instruments. However, that is just a formality and it is merely a matter of when that happens. Despite the ongoing case before the Irish courts, which was brought by an individual citizen, Ireland has not only completed its national constitutional procedures, but has formally deposited the instruments of ratification.",None

It is the first use of the European Union Act 2011, which sought to strike a balance between Liberal Democrat enthusiasm to maximise the benefits of EU membership and Conservative caution that we take not one step without adequate parliamentary scrutiny and, if necessary, legislation, and without the option of a referendum if power were being transferred from the British level to the European level. No such referendum is necessary on this occasion, as this is merely a Bill to ease the passage of the intergovernmental treaty for other members of the European Union. However, the full panoply of parliamentary scrutiny of legislation has been brought to bear even on this small, technical change.",None
"The Government’s commitment to a referendum also weakens the UK’s negotiating position with the rest of the EU. Opposition Members would like meaningful reform of the European Union, but we do not do that by blackmailing our European partners. Although my right hon. Friend the shadow Foreign Secretary has been specific about what kind of EU reform he would like, the same cannot be said of the Prime Minister’s speech last week, which gave very little detail about which powers he wanted to repatriate. Indeed, he did not even mention the word “repatriation”—much to the disgust, I am sure, of his Back Benchers—and he was also unclear about how he would campaign if he was not successful in that negotiation. When the Minister winds up, it would be useful for the rest of the House and the country if he put an end to that obscurity and told us which powers the Conservatives are attempting to bring back. What is their strategy, if they have one, and why are they so sure that the timing, in 2017, chimes with any sort of timing in the European Union? Chancellor Merkel has gone very lukewarm on the possibility of treaty change. It is not clear that we will have any treaty change between now and 2017.",Conflict

It seems to me that there are four possible answers to that question, and he has given four possible answers. One of them, which my hon. Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) has raised, relates to the question of sovereignty. The first possible answer on what is wrong with the current settlement on rights is that there is a problem of parliamentary sovereignty. The notion, which we could explore in greater depth, is that Parliament is sovereign and that the European Court of Human Rights, by overruling the decisions of the British Parliament, is not acting in accordance with the British constitution.",Moral Value
"There are a number of problems with the European arrest warrant, which have been highlighted by many other countries. The stats are quite simple. Nearly 1,000 requests for a European arrest warrant are issued each month. In 2009, the Serious Organised Crime Agency here in the UK received 4,004 requests for a European arrest warrant to be issued. To put that in context, between 2003 and 2009, the UK extradited 63 people to the United States, whereas in 2009-10, the UK extradited 699 individuals to the EU. Perhaps there is a problem with what the warrants are being issued for, which

causes a great deal of concern out there in civil society. The fundamental problem for people such as me is the extension of powers to the European Court of Justice. Given our experience of this matter nationally and internationally, we should be wary about that extension.",Powerlessness

In their fourth year in office, only one of the 261 new schools they promised in their “priority” building programme has actually been built; only seven of the 576 infrastructure projects they promised have been completed; and they have delivered a paltry 2,000 of the 100,000 new homes they promised under the NewBuy scheme. They said that they would set up a British investment bank to help businesses grow, but no business has yet had help. They said that they would set up the Youth Contract to get young people back to work, but no one has used it. They promised councils £530 million for superfast broadband, but so far they have paid out only £3 million. They said that they want more infrastructure spending, but yesterday revealed a £1 billion cut in capital spending. They said that they would bring down borrowing, but it is £245 billion higher than they planned. Is not the truth that they are posturing, not governing? They are spinning, not delivering.

Earlier, the Home Secretary responded to me on the issue of whether the opt-ins under the justice and home affairs provisions—if indeed we have opt-ins now—would trigger a referendum. She shared her view that they would not, but she did not give reasons and I do not believe she spoke to the specifics of the point. The European Union Act 2011 was ably taken through the House by the Minister for Europe, whom I am delighted to see in his place—he may be able to correct or assist me, or perhaps share some of the Government’s legal insight, which has eluded me to date on this issue. Section 4(1) deals with triggers for a referendum, and paragraph (i) refers to

“the conferring on an EU institution or body of power to impose a requirement or obligation on the United Kingdom”.

An even clearer trigger is section 4(1)(j), which refers to

“the conferring on an EU institution or body of new or extended power to impose sanctions on the United Kingdom”.

Numerous other examples could be cited.

The European arrest warrant is cost-efficient. If we relied on a 1957-type mechanism we would commit ourselves to footing the legal bill for extradition processes that went on for years and cost the public purse hundreds of thousands of pounds. The public and the judiciary are frustrated that the extradition of terrorists is often delayed for years. The return to the 1957 process could make this long, drawn-out process the norm.

As chair of the Better Off Out group of MPs and peers, my view is clearly that we would, as a nation, be better off out of the European Union. On far too many issues this Parliament has no choice but to simply carry out the instructions sent to us from the European Union, whether we like it or not.

"I am not terribly surprised to find out that Labour Members are split. I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention. He makes a good point but we disagree. That was not our experience in the Scottish independence referendum, which I shall go on to discuss.

We need to get more young people engaged in politics. All of us across the Committee can agree on that. Even if we disagree on this issue, we can all unite on that; I am sure the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) will agree on that. I know his views are held honestly. In the independence referendum, an astonishing 75% of 16 and 17-year-olds took the opportunity to vote. The same survey showed that 97% of them said that they would do so again. Turnout in the UK election was 66.1%. It was higher in Scotland than in the rest of the UK—because of the Scottish independence referendum, we like to think, and a more politicised electorate. There are lessons for us all to be taken from that.",Moral Value

There will be some people who are mature at 16 or perhaps less, and some who manage to hang on to their immaturity for a great many years after that. I do not believe that any of us can pinpoint an exact age.

One thing that the EU referendum has in common with the major constitutional referendum that took place in Scotland last year is that it is a decision for a long time into the future. To quote the right hon. Member for Gordon (Alex Salmond), who is not here today, it is a decision to be made once in a lifetime, or at least for a generation, not something to be repeated every few years. I hope that all hon. Members will agree with that. The referendum will not return every few years like general elections.",Moral Value

I am so pleased that there is an EU referendum because we can at last lance the boil that is Europe and bring this matter to an end. If we start to change the rules beforehand, certain parties who feel sore from the result will try to make out it has been fixed in a certain way. That is why the status quo should remain.",Moral Value

Even though we may have Governments we do not like from time to time, we have the chance of pressurising them in the short term and getting rid of them and replacing them with more progressive Governments in the long term.

Pressurising Governments is what I do in politics, as I think Members of all parties do. I want to see the Government elected in this country governing this country, not giving away our powers so that we are governed by a bureaucracy in Brussels or wherever.",Powerlessness

We are outnumbered by 10, 11, or 12-1 in population terms, so the representations that the UK Government make to Europe will always be loaded towards what they see to be in the best interest of the major nation.",Powerlessness

It needs to learn that in the run-up to the referendum campaign proper as well as in the campaign itself. My hon.

"Following reports in the weekend press, which seems to have been extremely well briefed, will the Prime Minister confirm that Britain will remain signed up to the European convention on human rights and will not repeal the Human Rights Act 1998? The lack of clarity and openness from the Prime Minister means we do not know on what basis he is negotiating. Too often, we have been guided by anonymous press briefings from his inner court. Let me say this to the Prime Minister: we will be on his side to support the proposed “red card” mechanism to give national Parliaments greater powers of influence over European legislation. In fact, it is such a good thing that it was in Labour’s manifesto at the general election. Does he agree with Angela Merkel, as we on the Labour Benches do, that

“there are achievements of European integration that cannot be haggled over, for example the principle of free movement and the principle of non-discrimination”?

Again, clarity from the Prime Minister on that would be welcomed not just, I suspect, by his own Back Benchers but by millions of people across the country.

The hon. Gentleman referred to a briefing in the weekend newspapers that he said seemed to be surprisingly well sourced about our plans. I am amazed that he feels it necessary to read or believe everything in the newspapers; I would have thought that that would be a route to deep unhappiness, so I advise that he desists at once. Let me tell him that our plans for a British Bill of Rights are unchanged. We want to get rid of the Human Rights Act and replace it with a British Bill of Rights.

We do need to reform free movement; it should not be free movement for criminals or for people who are benefit shopping, for example, and we are already taking steps to ensure that that is not the case.",Economic

"I now turn to the question of the extent to which we have entered into a sensible arrangement with Turkey. Turkey and the EU have signed a deal to give Turkey fast-track visa privileges in return for £3 billion-worth of aid and, I believe, the prospect of continuing financial support. There is also the prospect of a revitalised EU membership in return for a commitment to a migration action plan. I am profoundly cynical about this arrangement. I think it is based on giving money, almost in the nature of a bribe to Turkey. From what I have been hearing—and certainly from a meeting I attended very recently—the authorities in Turkey have been by no means diligent in enforcing the arrangements that are supposed to have been in place. The fact that so many people are making their way through the continent of Europe northwards towards Germany, causing an enormous amount of disruption, owes a great deal to the inefficiency with which I believe Turkey has been behaving recently.",Conflict
"Does the Prime Minister now accept that his attempts to bludgeon leaders into accepting his flawed reforms have failed and that he has come back with very little?

To deliver change, you need patient, effective diplomacy and you need to make friends.[Interruption.] Indeed we all value our friends. But the Prime Minister is not interested in that; he is more interested in his own party. He is playing politics, rather than putting forward the interests of the people of this country.

Can the Prime Minister now explain whether his Government will have a view on the choice facing the people of this country in the referendum, and how will that be reached and expressed? What has he had to say to Lord Heseltine, who said Britain would become

It was only because of what William Wilberforce and others did that people got to know more and more about it. Indeed, I quite confess that when I came to Parliament, I had no idea about human trafficking or modern-day slavery, and I certainly did not think I was going to get wrapped up in trying to solve the problem.

Anthony Steen and a small number of us travelled all over Europe, to places such as Moldova—to places that, to be honest, I had not even heard of—and found out about this terrible, terrible crime being committed of people being trafficked across borders.

What was once a continent across the channel with a faint novelty value is now being painted by many people as something sinister that is to be feared and demonised.

It has to pay VAT on those repairs. I wrote to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and said that given the extenuating circumstances, it would be a decent gesture for him to waive VAT on the repairs caused by that flooding. What was the answer? That the Chancellor’s hands are tied and he does not have the ability to waive VAT because that matter is decided by the European Union. Therefore, 20% will be added to the bill of my rowing club for the repairs from the flooding, and we cannot make decisions on VAT ourselves because they are decided for us by the European Union.

If it is so important for the Americans that we stay in the European Union, perhaps they will pay our £18 billion membership fee each year for us.

It beggars belief.

Apparently, the Government are not going to do any independent analysis over the next four months of what leaving the EU would mean for fishing. Presumably, at some stage or another, a Minister will make a claim—perhaps a fairly wild claim—and there will be no comeback, because the fishing Minister has been put in the corner, like a naughty boy with a dunce’s hat on his head, and told to keep silent.

"The speech of the day was, I thought, given by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)—not simply because of its length, but its quality as well. He made some erudite points, and I thought he was extremely honest about what the British nation might expect from the leave campaign when it comes to articulating what it would mean if we did leave. He was honest in raising some question marks over what might happen to the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy. Many people support these policies now, so it is important for them to understand the consequences of leaving. It was very honest of him to pose those questions, and the nation must hear the answers in a proper debate.

The “Project Fear” label has crept into the discussion many times. We want to win the arguments because people have decided on the merits—the whys and wherefores—of both sides, rather than because they were unclear about the position, or because one side had decided to scaremonger. What worries me is that this might descend into something like an American presidential election campaign, in which the negative overshadows the positives and the educated points of view.

Once, hopefully, the EU referendum campaign is over and we have convinced the country that we are better off in, I hope to see the Ministers who have quite recently come out in favour of our membership of the European Union occasionally talking about the benefits of our being in the EU. The difficulty over the next four months is that many of those Ministers who have now rightly stated that, on balance, we are better off in the European Union, have previously not highlighted some of the positives involved. This suggestion that Ministers should speak more positively about the EU will have no cost to the FCO.

On Syria, it would be helpful to know exactly what is being built in the budget for what we hope will happen after the ceasefire. If the ceasefire holds, and we get to a position in which there is a degree of stabilisation in Syria, there will clearly be a need for the FCO to make quite a substantial financial commitment to greater involvement in the stabilisation process that should then follow.

I accept that the Government are trying now to address the problem, but only in terms of improving the fences and security. My contention, and that of my hon. Friend, is that we also have to deal with the pull factor.

This illegal migration into this country is very serious in terms of public policy. Some people might say, “Maybe we want more immigration—maybe these people provide low-cost cheap labour”, and all the rest of it. I would argue that the ready availability of cheap labour reduces the need for employers to modernise their economy, and that for too long Governments have relied on open borders and cheap wages to keep the economy afloat. The problem with this large-scale migration—illegal migration is the worst aspect—is that it is totally unsustainable in the long run in terms of the economy, public policy and public opinion.",Economic
"The Government’s position has remained unchanged while the final details of the contracts have been ironed out. In November, we set out that we expected to conclude the deal in the coming months, and the Secretary of State made it clear that she was minded to proceed with the contract for difference support package for the deal, subject to any change in circumstances. We remain confident that all parties are firmly behind Hinkley Point C and are working hard towards a final investment decision. We have received assurances from EDF and the French Government—EDF’s largest shareholder—on this point.

The rest of the legislation going through this House is properly timetabled and regulated. This behaviour must end, as our constituents are taking an increasing interest in private Members’ Bills.

Finally, on income tax, the current situation is that the Welsh people would have to support the devolution of income tax in a referendum before the powers could be transferred to the Assembly. This Bill removes that requirement, meaning that the Secretary of State could devolve income tax powers via an Order in Council, without the Assembly even having to agree to it. That cannot be right.

Wages account for only a third of total costs, so people would have to take a 30% pay cut or lose their jobs. There are 450,000 jobs at risk.

The hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) have visited textile factories that, outside the EU, would face a 6.5% tariff. It is hard to cut wages in such factories because the Low Pay Commission reports that most of the workers are on the minimum wage, so another 56,000 jobs are at risk, mainly in the north and the midlands. When I challenged the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip about that, he said that

“there is no need for them to worry.”

It is all right for him: on top of his MP’s salary, he takes home another £250,000 every year for his column in The Daily Telegraph. His attitude is flippant to the point of irresponsibility, and this is not a joke.",Economic
"For once, I have great sympathy with the hon. Gentleman. That was why I chose to aim at the issue by saying that people could come here and work, but could not get full access to our welfare system for four years. That addressed the concern that his and my constituents have that there should not be something for nothing. The point that we have to understand is that European Union countries see the single market as consisting not only of the free movement of goods, people, services and capital. They see those things bound together, but they also see the single market as including the payments that countries make into the EU to strengthen the weakest members and those that have recently recovered from communism. Of course, one can try to negotiate amendments to these movements—and I did—but one has to think about that mindset as we go into the negotiation.",Economic

"The impact on car manufacturers has not been properly dealt with either. This is not simply about our opening new trade markets around the world; it is about a supply chain that is deeply embedded throughout Europe. A typical drive shaft for a family saloon car is manufactured in six different countries across Europe. What are car manufacturers to do if tariffs are applied between us and the EU? Just last evening, I was talking to a multinational retailer who had 3,000 members of staff but was moving to new premises with 5,000 members of staff. These people move from London to Frankfurt to Paris just as we would move from North Yorkshire to London, but they face the prospect of not being able to do that. How have we made this decision without talking about these issues and answering these questions?

There is an even bigger issue. Looking at the European Union in such a sensitive stage, I view it as a house of cards, and if the UK pulls our card from the bottom, there is a significant risk that the whole house will implode. A domestic economic risk then moves towards becoming an international and global economic risk, along with a political risk and a security risk.

It is successive Governments who have failed to deal with the issue of social and economic inequality. The gap between the rich and the poor is now even bigger, and five families in the United Kingdom own some 20% of the UK’s wealth. The issues that need to be addressed—such as eradicating poverty and providing equal opportunities—are not being tackled. Immigrants are accused of being the cause of all that and they are used as a natural target—that is what Vote Leave campaigners campaigned on.",Moral Value

On Monday the Minister expressed genuine sympathy with many of those arguments, and it is abundantly clear from what he has said that he wants to get us to a position whereby EU citizens can and will remain in the country. Sympathy and expressions of hope, however, are not enough. Clarity and reassurance now are essential, and they can and should be delivered.

The reasons offered by the Government for refusing to provide that clarity are absurd and bizarre.

With debt, deficit and borrowing levels forecast to get worse after Brexit, and with more than £40 billion to be cut from public services by 2020, spending £167 billion, £179 billion, or £205 billion—whatever the number is that the Government are not prepared tell us—is an outrage. The Prime Minister’s first vote is on Trident. In the current climate, that is totally wrong. It is the wrong approach to key priorities. We should be working to stabilise the economy and sorting out the chaos caused by the Brexit result.

Universities face the prospect of losing out across the board, so how will they fare in this post-Brexit world when the calls to curb immigration inevitably come? Universities have been warning for years that making student visas harder to come by was having a hugely damaging effect, as indeed the right hon. Member for East Devon (Mr Swire) just said. Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield, estimates that 40% of his university’s income from teaching comes from international students, and non-UK students also generate £11 billion for the wider UK economy.

If it is all the school’s fault, then I have a really good idea—take all the widening participation funding from higher education and put it into schools and early years, because vice-chancellors have made a compelling case for transferring it in that way. That is not to denigrate the excellent work done by staff working on widening participation and student recruitment in institutions; they are some of the most passionate and dedicated staff in terms of changing the profile of the student body.

Across Scotland, the financial sector directly and indirectly employs almost 200,000 people, 20,000 of whom are European Union workers. It contributes £8 billion to the economy of Scotland.

It was accepted by this House, under the Severn Bridges Act 1992, that those charges should be in place for a certain period. That period will come to an end later this year or early next year, when the Severn bridges have the same status as every other piece of motorway in the rest of the United Kingdom, and should be treated as such.

This is, as we know, to be the hardest of hard Brexits, with cuts yet unimaginable and consequences yet unconceived—and for what? If we were doing this for some lofty ideal or grand purpose, like maybe addressing global poverty or some of the huge issues of injustice around the world, that might make it just about palatable, but no—we are doing it because the UK does not like immigration. That is the cold, beating heart of this bad British Brexit, and it underpins absolutely everything concerning our departure from the EU. It takes precedence over everything else, and all other considerations are merely consequential. The fact is that we live in an interconnected, globalised world where the movements of people have never been so profound, sometimes fleeing from persecution, or perhaps exchanging skills and ideas. Yet we are asked to believe the myth that a Brexitised UK will beat back this historic tide like some sort of Farageous Canute.

In the fast-paced area of video games, we are constantly at the cutting edge. The creative economy accounts for one in every 11 jobs.

To the contrary, it will make our politics meaner and our country poorer.

Despite all the optimism and jingoism we have heard from those on the Government Benches in the last two days of debate—there have been many terrific and many difficult speeches—I cannot credit the notion that the best way to make Britain a successful global trading nation is to withdraw from the most sophisticated global market the world has ever created.

The scheme will benefit the whole of the UK.

Some might argue that being in the EEA or a member of EFTA precisely gives one not just access to but membership of the single market—one could call it access if one likes. There was deep, deep confusion in the messaging of the no side, which must be rectified now with proper details on the trajectory of the key economic numbers before more decisions are taken.

I say that we are facing a hard Brexit, and let us understand what has been said. The leaked Treasury document last November suggested that the UK could lose up to £66 billion from a hard Tory Brexit and that GDP could fall by about 9.5% if the UK reverted to WTO rules. I accept that that is a worst-case scenario, but if the circumstances that lead us to that catastrophe occur and we do not have a plan to mitigate it, the guilt would lie with the Government for failing to plan. The final part of that—the “if we revert to WTO rules”—is key, because the Prime Minister has said that a bad deal is worse than no deal. That is very twisted logic, because no deal is the worst deal; it means we revert immediately to WTO rules, with all the tariffs and other regulatory burdens that that implies.",Economic

I am not sure that he and I disagree on that. Between cutting off all immigration and having open-door immigration, there is enormous scope for some sensible diplomacy.

The great advantage of this compromise proposal for fishermen is that, while coming out of the common fisheries policy, they would still have access to the single market.

"Since the SNP Government came to office in 2007, the value of Scottish food exports has more than doubled, with businesses in my constituency enjoying excellent levels of growth. What impact assessment has the Department carried out on the impact of Brexit on such excellent growth, or is there simply a fingers-crossed approach? This morning at 9.21, I received a response from the Scotland Office to a question I posed to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and we now know that the Scotland Office has not made any assessment of the impact of Brexit on Scottish trade.",Economic
"That brings us nicely to “no deal being better than a bad deal”. The Prime Minister has shown that that she cannot even negotiate a deal with her “friends and allies” from the DUP—worse, she did not even realise that at first. On 10 June, we heard an announcement, “We’ve got a deal with the DUP.” Then we heard, “We don’t have a deal with the DUP.” The Queen’s Speech was put back two days to allow the deal to be formulated, yet here we are and there is still no deal with the DUP. So how can we trust that Prime Minister to lead a minority Government and get a better deal with the other 27 member states of the EU? That does not add up.",Conflict

For many years, for reasons now lost to history, Torbay schools have been some of the lowest funded per pupil in the whole country, and that desperately needs to be addressed. There are certainly inequalities issues in Torbay, and we are not just a leafy retirement area. We have real challenges, and our schools deserve to be fairly funded. That is why I am pleased to again hear a commitment on that issue. Yes, there will be a need to work through how the funding formula works correctly for all, but concerns cannot be used as a reason to stick with the current formula, which so disadvantages many children in my constituency.",Human Impact
"We might be able to get somewhere with New Zealand, and, when they have finished with TTIP, we might be able to get somewhere with President Trump’s United States, but there will be difficulties even there. We must have an agreement with the New Zealanders. They are our best friends in the world on this kind of subject, they run a very well-governed country, they are very well disposed to us, and they share our views on free trade. Nevertheless, their first demand will have to be the lifting of quotas and tariffs on lamb. That will pose problems for our troubled agricultural sector, so we had better prepare to handle that carefully.

The first demand of any American Administration—assuming we even get anywhere with the protectionist and isolationist current Administration—will be that we open up to their beef. Personally, I do not have any hang-ups about hormone-treated beef, but there will have to be some quite hard negotiations about exactly how far we are going to open up our market to the Americans, who are always anxious to get rid of their heavily subsidised agricultural produce. They will not regard us as strong bargaining partners in the situation we have put ourselves in. I shall not go on, but the whole idea of leaving the customs union has its limitations.",Economic

We need to ensure that the public are protected by updating the UK’s financial protection scheme for holidaymakers. It is important to keep pace with the innovation in the online travel market and ensure that appropriate protection is in place, regardless of whether consumers choose to book online or on the high street. Of course we want to make it easier for UK companies when selling holidays across Europe, and they will be able to trade under the UK’s ATOL scheme as opposed to the regimes in each country they sell to. The measures in this Bill are important as we need it to cover new digital business models and modern consumer purchasing models.",Economic

It is also a privilege to follow some of the speeches that have been made here today, especially that of the hon. Member for Stone (Sir William Cash). When he speaks on these issues, I often think that his constituency has been badly and underwhelmingly named. It should be renamed the rock, because he acts like a rock—he is solid on these issues—when he speaks before this House. Once again, he has shown his breadth of knowledge and skill in this particular area. I wholeheartedly concur with his point that the European Scrutiny Committee should be reactivated—and reactivated very quickly—because, as we exit the EU, we will need to scrutinise these matters very closely and ensure that we consider the details that will come up during the exiting process. The Committee is one vehicle that could be used to that advantage, and I wish him well in his quest to have it re-established.",None

"An industrial strategy and international trade White Paper should have come together precisely because of the interdependence of trade, job creation, and economic growth. That makes Labour Members fearful that the Government have not done the proper assessment of the danger that future trade arrangements could pose for job losses and wage depression. The Government have put the cart before the horse. A trade White Paper should set out what the UK’s future policy on trade defence instruments will be. The EU currently has in place a series of trade defence measures, such as anti-dumping measures against China—and, to a lesser degree, India and Malaysia—on steel, other metals, and solar panels. The UK has famously opposed such measures at the EU. Now that we will be able to set our own trade policy, the Government must tell us whether they will stick to that line. If they do not plan to introduce trade defence measures, they need to set out whether and how they will protect and support sensitive sectors such as the steel industry and the solar panel industry from cheap imports.",Economic

This is the first time I have spoken since the general election and, of course, I want to begin by thanking my constituents for taking part in the election—especially those who voted Labour. The majority of my constituents voted to leave the European Union in the referendum last year, and when I discuss that with them they tell me that they want a Brexit that controls immigration but boosts exports and secures long-term jobs, particularly in manufacturing. What they like about the European Union is the social chapter, the common market—what we call the customs union—the environmental protections, co-operation on research and development, and the European arrest warrant.",Human Impact
"It is true that business never likes uncertainty, and there is undoubtedly uncertainty in certain areas of our regulatory and legal frameworks surrounding financial services. If the House will indulge me, I will address two of those areas. First, as Members will fully appreciate, a key area that has been highlighted is this country’s desire to continue benefiting from the single passport for financial services that operates within member states of the European Union, whereby a firm that obtains authorisation to carry out a particular activity in one state can carry out such activity in other member states without further authorisation or regulation. It would be good to hear from the Minister and the Secretary of State whether we intend to try to maintain that position.",Economic
"The US President attempts to pull the plug on the Paris climate change deal, and that gets only a belated informal mention in a brief meeting with him; there was no opportunity to sign a joint letter from European leaders at the time he made the announcement. The UK’s trade deficit is growing, at a time when we are negotiating our exit from the European Union. The UK-backed Saudi war in Yemen continues to kill, displace and injure thousands, and there have been 300,000 cases of cholera—this is a man-made catastrophe. Worse, the Government continue to sell arms to Saudi Arabia, one of the most repressive and brutal regimes, which finances terrorism and is breaching humanitarian law. The Court may have ruled that the Government acted legally, but they are certainly not acting ethically.

Essentially, the clause updates ATOL—the air travel organisers’ licence—to ensure that it is harmonised with the 2015 EU package travel directive. The provision therefore extends ATOL to cover a wider range of holidays and protect more consumers. UK travel companies, we are told, will be able to sell more seamlessly across Europe, as they will need to comply with protections based not in the country of sale, but the country in which they are established. Those are the objectives that the Government seek to achieve. There is no difference of principle between the Government and the Opposition on this matter.

"Effective, targeted sanctions policy is one of those tools. Sanctions have helped resolve complex and serious policy issues—for example, by bringing Iran to the negotiating table to agree to robust constraints on its nuclear programme. The UK currently implements 34 sanctions regimes, around half of which result from legally binding resolutions of the UN Security Council, and half from additional measures agreed with partners in the European Union. We must retain the ability to impose, update and lift sanctions regimes, both to comply with our international obligations and to pursue our wider foreign policy and national security objectives after we exit the European Union.

The referendum result last year was a clear message from the people of the United Kingdom that we need to change our relationship with the European Union and take back control of our laws, and this Government are delivering on that instruction through the ongoing negotiations, the second round of which is under way this week, and through the introduction of essential legislation, such as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which the Government published last week.",Powerlessness

When we talk about the legislators taking back control, we mean just that—legislators, in the plural.

Having said that I would follow that instruction, I am now duty bound to become greatly and passionately interested in the shape of our EU departure. I very much intend to do that.

I am still drawn to the Norwegian argument that those on the remain side used as a reason why we should stay. We do not want to be a member of the single market, but be unable to influence its shape and have to pay into its obligations.

Perhaps I need to remind Government Front Benchers of the results of those referendums on the sort of government we want in Wales and with what sort of powers. The first was carried narrowly in 1997 and the second, on a modest extension of powers, was carried overwhelmingly in 2011, with the support of all parties and with the no campaign having degenerated into an obsessional, deluded and irrelevant rabble—I am sorry to see that the hon.

The Bill’s approach is dangerous because parliamentary sovereignty in this country is such a weak reed. It has been a weak reed for many years. Executives of all hues—even, dare I say, coalitions—have, through the Whip system, managed to ensure that this House has not really taken part in some of the key decisions of the day. This is most seen in the way that the House debates Government expenditure decisions. Right hon. and hon.

"I shall be brief and to the point, as we are about to reach a critical stage in proceedings.

Like many hon. Members, particularly Opposition Members, I voted to remain in the European Union. Like many others, I was active in my constituency and throughout the west midlands in arguing that case, particularly to the manufacturers and traders for which the region is well known. I was disappointed, like many people, that the referendum turned out the other way. A result of 48:52 is pretty close, but in Coventry it was 40:60—60% of people voted to leave and 40% to remain.

When it came to the triggering of article 50 in the House, I had little doubt in my mind—indeed, I would never think of going against a clearly democratic vote—that we would have to do so, and we duly did. However, I also set out a couple of points that I thought would be essential if we were to avoid the worst aspects of what Brexit could mean: we needed a transitional period to the new arrangements, and those arrangements should be as soft as possible. I believe that both those points are as valid today as they were then. I agreed to sit back and watch how far the Government could get on achieving them.

The agency replaced the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. It collects data about fundamental rights and seeks to engage the public and civil society on tackling such issues. That sounds to me very much like the work of the Council of Europe. I have returned this morning from Strasbourg, where the plenary session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe is still going on. That body needs a lot of reorganisation and work to bring it up to scratch. However, there was mention earlier of what we might do post-Brexit to engage with such agencies, and it occurs to me that there would be an opportunity, if we were so minded, for us to consider how we might bolster an organisation such as the Council of Europe and wrap things up, rather than duplicating effort.",Moral Value

I hope we will soon have a response from the Government to that report; it is one of those that is in Ministers’ in-tray—or, I hope, out-tray—at the Ministry of Justice. Perhaps a gentle nudge might be delivered by those on the Treasury Bench to their right hon. Friends there.

The report is constructive and stresses the importance of information-sharing arrangements for the legal system and the justice system. Part of that relates to the UK’s legal services, and that links in to what I said earlier about the financial services sector in London. The legal service sector underpins a great deal of that financial services work, so getting this issue right is critical for UK firms contracting with parties in the EU or with third parties. At the moment, a great deal of work is written in English law, and that is a great advantage to us, so getting the data sharing right around all those matters is terribly important to the firms involved.",Economic

However, it is of the utmost importance that we commit to these rules for the long term and provide certainty for individuals and businesses. The economic consequences of not being able to move personal data would be very serious, with companies having to double-store data.

Despite the mounting evidence of recent months, the Foreign Secretary was still insisting last week that he had seen no evidence of Russian interference, but on Monday the Prime Minister said, or at least implied, something very different in her Mansion House speech. She excoriated the Putin regime for hacking, interfering in elections, and spreading fake news to sow discord in western democracies and threaten our international order.",Conflict
"The truth is that because of our membership of the European Union there are some things that many of us would regard as rights but which fall outside the scope of the Human Rights Act and the European convention, and those things have developed over the same period I mentioned as a result of our European Union membership. I appreciate that that leads to double choking over the cornflakes, because not only have those rights come from what some people might regard as a tainted source—although I am blowed if I can think why: it is just another international treaty—but on top of that is the fact that once in place the charter has no regard for our parliamentary sovereignty. It has the capacity to trump our domestic laws if there is an incompatibility between our domestically enacted laws and the principles of, or anything that has come from, the charter. That is part of the supremacy of EU law to which we have all been subject.",Powerlessness
"That was the focus of last week’s debate, but this week the debate is about securing the proper transfer of the rights and protections of EU law on to our statute book. That is something on which the Government have made strong claims. They have made two very clear propositions about this Bill. The first is that it serves to provide certainty and legal continuity, through the creation of the new category of retained EU law. Indeed, on Second Reading, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union said:

“The key point of this Bill is to avoid significant and serious gaps in our statute book.”—[Official Report, 7 September 2017; Vol. 628, c. 344.]

The Government’s second claim is that the Bill

“does not remove any underlying fundamental rights or principles which exist”.",None
"However, I would argue that there is still a real lack of clarity, and a danger that if we allow only principles that have been litigated on to apply post-exit day, the non-controversial ones that people do not have a problem with will end up falling away, while only the controversial ones are retained It is also unclear whether these general principles include environmental principles, as the term “general principles” has not been defined by the ECJ or by the treaties If environmental principles are not explicitly recognised as general principles, they could be lost entirely I hope that the Minister can give us a bit of clarity on that.",Powerlessness
"The existing right to Francovich damages is linked to EU membership and the obligations that we have as a member state to the EU at an international level. There is clearly a difference between substantive EU law, which is being kept by the Bill to prevent legal uncertainty, and the supranational procedural rules, principles and frameworks that will no longer be appropriate once we have left the EU.

Let me turn briefly to amendments 139 and 302, which take a slightly different approach. They would maintain the right to Francovich damages in domestic law, but only in relation to pre-exit causes of action. Amendment 335 would similarly maintain the right to Francovich damages in domestic law for causes of action occurring during any transitional period. The Bill sets out elsewhere—at paragraph 27 of schedule 8—that the exclusion of the right to Francovich damages would apply only in relation to claims that are brought after exit day.

I would like to assure my right hon. Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan), and indeed all Members, that we will consider further whether any additional specific and more detailed transitional arrangements should be set out in regulations.",None
"Beyond the public finances, household balance sheets are also under pressure. Rising interest rates, high inflation, lower wage growth and a working-age benefits freeze all stand to put pressure on ordinary households. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has set out two important principles for Conservative-led Governments: first, work should always pay; and, secondly, people should keep more of the money that they earn. I am happy, as I think all Conservative Members are, to support him on those two principles.

The pressures on household finances—the Committee is looking at them as part of our inquiry into household finances—will be exacerbated, particularly for the younger generation, if action is not taken to tackle long-standing problems in the housing market, as my right hon. Friend said. I therefore welcome the measures on housing. He has announced a comprehensive package on skills, land availability and financial incentives to get Britain building. I also welcome the review that will be chaired by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Sir Oliver Letwin). We always know there is a problem when my right hon. Friend is sent for to solve it. He will look at the gap between permissions granted and houses built, and why it exists.",Economic
"That is fine, but in my west London constituency many people just dream about having a home, let alone owning one. Young and even not-so-young people are unlikely to be able to leave their parents’ homes. Families are in poor-quality temporary accommodation that they can hardly afford, and they are always at risk of having to move—often for years on end. There is no hope for them. The Red Book correctly goes on to state that average house prices in London are 12 times the average worker’s salary, but then it says:

“The only sustainable way to make housing more affordable over the long term is to build more homes in the right places.”

There is not a jot evidence to show that building more homes in London would bring prices down in the current distorted housing market. Even if it did, shaving a few thousand off the asking price of a new home would not help my constituents earning less than £100,000 or who do not have a six-figure deposit from the bank of mum and dad.",Human Impact

That is why the announcement of the creation of the centre for data ethics and innovation is incredibly important. The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, which I chair, will be looking at the distribution of disinformation and how companies’ algorithms either support or could act against it.

He set out very robustly the views of his constituents, not only those who are “yellowbellies” born and bred, but those who have had the good sense to move to his constituency from the European Union.

Since the result of the referendum last summer, the Government have made absolutely clear how important it is for us to secure the status of EU citizens here as soon as possible.

Those amendments will need to reflect where the powers will eventually rest, and whether they will go straight to the devolved Administrations on the day we leave the European Union, or if some will be subject to mutual agreements—memorandums of understanding—that will create the frameworks to support the functioning of the UK’s internal market.

Some extremely superficial desk research was proffered as if it were the Rosetta stone, but the paucity of what has been delivered leads me to the inescapable conclusion that the Government have no idea what is or might be down the road, or what turns the road might be taking before we get there. The only certainty Ministers seem to have is that the map says “Here be no monsters”. Well, there are monsters, and they are in the Bill. The monsters are those that will damage devolution settlements with the tearing away of responsibility, power and resources from the devolved Administrations to be sucked into the abyss that is a Whitehall trying to deal with Brexit.",Powerlessness
"I have read the Bill very carefully. As right hon. and hon. Members will know, the Good Friday agreement or Belfast agreement was an international agreement between the Irish Government and the British Government. As an international agreement, it had to be incorporated in our domestic law, and that was done by the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Good Friday agreement is absolutely fundamental. It has given us peace and stability for the past 20 years in Northern Ireland, and there can be no denying that. Unfortunately, the first mention of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, which incorporated the Good Friday agreement in our domestic law, is in clause 7. It is not at the beginning of clause 7 but in subsection (6), and it is not at the beginning of subsection (6) but in paragraph (f) at the end.",Moral Value
"However, we are where we are. It is clear that we will have to try to manage the Brexit process in a way that does not adversely impact on the Good Friday agreement. I listened carefully to DUP Members, and I can well understand that any suggestion that leaving the EU involves uncoupling Northern Ireland and putting it into a separate regulatory regime for the benefit of maintaining the Good Friday agreement, or regulatory equivalence with the Republic of Ireland, is a complete non-starter. It is totally unacceptable to me, and I did not understand the Prime Minister’s words and the agreement she reached as being indicative of her intending to do any such thing. If she was, all I can say is that she will not long survive her party’s views, which are unanimous on this matter, irrespective of whether Members most enthusiastically embraced Brexit or most vigorously sought to prevent it. We therefore need to park that on one side.",Conflict
"The chaos of such divergence must be avoided. That is why I oppose the various amendments to clause 10 and schedule 2 that seek to increase the delegated powers of the devolved Administrations. There is no power grab in the Bill, just common sense. However, it is important that the devolved Administrations have appropriate delegated powers to correct legislation to ensure that it continues to function after Brexit. Maintaining the statute book and minimising disruption is the entire point of the Bill, after all.

Giving delegated powers to the devolved Administrations is a necessary consequence of our devolution settlement and of the fact that—much like here in Westminster—in Holyrood, Cardiff Bay and, in time, Stormont, the changes that need to be made cannot be made just by primary legislation. As the Minister stated, it is important that the devolved Administrations’ powers are substantial enough for them to be able to make the right tweaks, rather than feeling unable to do anything more than make bare-bones tweaks that leave the statute book barely functioning. We want a fully functioning statute book after Brexit, not a barely functioning one.",Powerlessness

I was simply pointing out a legal reality.",Powerlessness
"I will talk more about Brexit later, because first I want to discuss a matter that needs urgent attention and about which we have already spoken to the Immigration Minister—namely, non-European economic area crew on the Scottish fleet. We are not talking about unskilled labour, which is often the perception; we are talking about fishermen who are experienced and qualified professionals. Like farming, with which I grew up, I think that fishing is a trade for which people need passion to make a real go of it. Also like farming, I think that it is something that people need to be born into. It is certainly something that many fishermen are born into, whether they happen to have been born in the coastal communities of Peterhead, Fraserburgh or Macduff in my constituency or, indeed, in the Philippines or further afield.

The industry recognises the need for a transition, so that it can be sustainable with regard to local labour, but that will take time, mainly because we need to undo the decades of damage done by top-down EU policies such as the CFP.

A small number of companies are leeching so much money out of our public services through the high costs of private finance contracts, and their high rates of returns and interest rates. Government Members can look at them as hire purchase agreements for the public sector. The Bill could have been the opportunity to set a clear red line for those companies, and to tell them that, instead of continuing to rip off our schools and our hospitals, we want them to come to the table to renegotiate contracts. The Bill could have been the opportunity to set up that moratorium, or to use the banking levy as a model for a windfall tax on such companies—a tax that could claim back the excessive profits that they are clearly making from the public sector. This is money that could have properly funded our police or gone towards ensuring that we pay our public sector workers properly, but we will all end up paying for that omission from this Bill. With the PF2 contracts coming online, it is clear that the Government have not learned the lessons about the cost of public sector borrowing that would have informed the Bill.",Economic

Even then, she is not sure whether she wants to be part of just the European Medicines Agency, the European Chemicals Agency and the European Aviation Safety Agency, or if she wants to be part of others, too. She does not have an answer on services, the area in which we enjoy a trade surplus with the EU, but rather talks about creativity and ambition in finding solutions. There is no trade deal anywhere in the world that gets close to guaranteeing the access we have to Europe for our services industry. Our major export to the EU is financial services; Canada’s is pearls and semi-precious metals. The idea that we base our future trading arrangements on a Canadian-style free trade agreement while ruling out being part of the EEA is absolute madness.",Economic

Furthermore, if I may be allowed a small analogy, if I come to buy your car, Madam Deputy Speaker, whatever odd sticker you might have in the windscreen, we both want something: I want your car and you want my cash. At the outset, we must both be prepared to walk away. That is the point that my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) made, and that, as we all know, is how business works.

"As we implement the decision of the British people to leave the EU at the end of March 2019, we want a deep and special partnership with the European Union. The Government set out in our future partnership paper last summer two options for our future customs arrangements—two options that most closely meet these objectives. One is a highly streamlined customs arrangement. That approach comprises a number of measures to help to minimise barriers to trade, from negotiating the continuation of some existing trade facilitations to the introduction of new technology-based solutions. The other is a new customs partnership, which is an unprecedented and innovative approach under which the UK would mirror the EU’s requirements for imports from the rest of the world that are destined for the EU, removing a need for a formal customs border between the UK and the EU. Those models were detailed again in the Government’s White Paper last October, and by the Prime Minister in her Mansion House speech and subsequent statement to the House. We look forward to discussing both those options with our European partners and with businesses in both the UK and the EU as negotiations progress.",Economic

Unfortunately, I do not think the same can be said yet in Wales. We also see some divergence in areas such as public sector pay. The Scottish Government have lifted the cap on wage rises for public sector workers, meaning, for example, that a nurse earning £30,000 a year will get a 3% rise in the coming financial year. That is in stark contrast, unfortunately, to the Welsh Administration, who insist that Westminster needs to loosen the purse strings before they take action.",Economic

He has said that the EU will act in good faith during the transition period and not seek to undermine existing fishing communities.

The latter has three factories, two in the Republic and one in Northern Ireland, and if ever we needed an example of why we need to transition to a soft border, that company is it. Its process involves milk crossing the border three times: first, it comes across in fluid form; then it goes back in powder form; and then it comes back again to Newtownards, where it is packaged and processed, and sold across the world. Rich Sauces is another agri-food business in my constituency that is doing extremely well, and we must remember that this is about not just the guys in the factories doing the production and manufacturing, but the farmers supplying the milk, and those providing arable goods for vegetable firms.

How have Russian oligarchs been allowed to roam freely and acquire status and respectability in the UK? Are the Government aware of the allegations in the current edition of Private Eye that eight Moscow parliamentarians and officials own substantial property in London?

She might like to welcome the fact that the highest growth in investment spending in the G7 last year came to the United Kingdom. She might like to welcome the fact that our day-to-day spending is in surplus for the first time in 16 years, and certainly since her Government were in power in 2001 and 2002.

I think that people in Northern Ireland are increasingly frustrated by the silly nonsense and the politicking.

I will address in turn the main issues covered by this group on which the House of Lords has asked this House to think again but where their lordships’ approach has either undermined the essential purpose of the Bill, or attempted to overrule well-considered amendments from this House.

The first such area is the sifting system proposed in this House by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker), the Chairman of our Procedure Committee. The proposal was that a committee would consider instruments subject to the negative procedure that were brought forward under the main powers in the Bill, and could recommend that they be subject to the affirmative procedure instead. This unanimous recommendation of the cross-party Procedure Committee was clearly born out of careful and detailed consideration by that Committee, and the Government were happy to accept it. My hon.

That is a sensible approach. It provides certainty about our exit day, but it also incorporates the terms of article 50. Let us remember that exit day will be determined by international law rather than by this House.

We discussed this issue at length when we considered the Bill that became the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. Their lordships have suggested that this House abandons the conclusions of the lengthy and considered debates that we have already had on this issue by returning the Bill in broadly the same state in which it was first introduced.

We believe that when Parliament has considered the final deal or the absence of a deal, the public should have the final say on the matter. This is not an extraordinary observation. Countries that rule by plebiscite, such as Switzerland, regard confirmatory referendums as a matter of course. The people vote and then the legislature and Executive review the matter.

I will come back to where I started and talk about the relationship of Brexit to this debate on the strength or otherwise of the Union and to Scottish self-government. What has been happening over the last period has substantially weakened the Union because it weakens the devolution settlement that arguably could have given it some strength 20 years ago. This is happening in three ways. First, for the first time in our history, the UK Government are determined to ignore the Sewel convention and to legislate for matters that relate to the devolved Scottish Parliament without obtaining its consent. [Interruption.] That is a regrettable fact, but there is no point in Scottish Conservative Members trying to deny it.",Powerlessness

"What we have seen is businesses showing confidence in our economy. In August, Dyson announced £200 million of investment in its electric vehicle testing facility in Wiltshire, and 2 Sisters Food Group—Bernard Matthews—has won major new contracts with supermarkets, underpinning 600 new jobs. The Hut Group has announced 200 new tech jobs in Salford. We welcomed £130 million of foreign direct investment in our automotive sector from four companies in July, generating around 500 new jobs.

What we are doing is negotiating a Brexit deal that will deliver for this country and deliver on the vote of the British people, and will ensure that we do so while protecting jobs, maintaining our Union and ensuring no hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. And what do we get from the right hon. Gentleman? He said that he wants to do new trade deals, and now he wants to be in the customs union. At one stage he was asked about his view on free movement, and he said:

“Labour is not wedded to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a point of principle, but…nor do we rule it out.”

So he cannot even agree with himself on his own position.",Economic
"Our science sector leads the world, powering our economy in the process. Science is an engine of job creation: 20% of the UK workforce is employed in science roles, and wages for these jobs are 40% higher than the average. Science is crucial to creating the high-skilled, high-wage, high-productivity economy we in Labour want to see. Our science sector is intertwined with our European partners’ through pooled funding, the free exchange of talent and shared institutions. I shall talk to each of those.

According to the Government’s own 2013 report, it is the increasing internationalisation of UK science, powered in part by European collaboration, that has allowed us to surpass the US in science productivity. I am glad, therefore, that the Government are committed to achieving what they call

“a far-reaching science and innovation pact”,

but as the Committee’s report points out, delays are

“undermining the UK’s position as a science superpower”,

“very real threat to scientific progress” ,

"But I do want to say a few words about Russia. Given the challenges to the global international order that we face and the direct challenges to our country as a result of the criminal murder in our country by the Russian state, this is the worst possible time for our country to be leaving the European Union. We need partners, allies and international co-operation. I asked the Prime Minister about this yesterday and she confirmed how important it is that we continue to have security and defence co-operation with our EU neighbours and friends. That is not guaranteed if we get the no deal situation and we have no agreement—I will leave that there.

What is also clear is that we need to be serious about not only the crimes in Salisbury, but the 14 other suspicious deaths linked to Russia that have occurred in recent years. There has been a remarkable development this week, with the Chair of the Select Committee on Home Affairs being written to by the Home Secretary in a letter that said:",Powerlessness

I suspect that many right hon. and hon. Members, particularly those who took part in its Committee stage, will share my view that the year-long passage of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 was perhaps the most demanding legislative exercise that Parliament has undertaken in recent decades. The process of overlaying and amending that byzantine piece of legislation with the proposed EU withdrawal agreement Bill will be equally, if not more, complicated and onerous. That is why we welcome the publication of the White Paper before the summer recess and the opportunity for further debate today on the Government’s early expectations for that Bill.",None
"It has been said by people from all parties that somehow or another Brexit presents a moment of stress for the Union of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The truth is that that is the Union that matters the most to me. I often say that I did not sleep very much in the weeks leading up to the referendum in 2014. That was a time of intense worry and concern for me, and I felt nothing like that before the June 2016 vote. The Union that matters the most to me and to millions of Scots is the Union that we have with England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Here are the realities to stem any thought—other than the flight of imaginative fancy that we hear from nationalist politicians in Scotland and in this place—that there would be any desire to break up this hugely successful Union of nations that we call the United Kingdom: Scottish exports to the United Kingdom are worth £46 billion; Scottish exports to the rest of the world are worth £17 billion; and Scottish exports to the EU27 are worth £13 billion. According to the Fraser of Allander Institute, 125,000 Scottish jobs are related to EU exports—I do not want to lose one of them—but 529,000 Scottish jobs are related to business with the rest of the United Kingdom. These are the economic facts of life.",Economic
"Last week at Prime Minister’s questions, the Leader of the Opposition raised comments by the National Farmers Union that a no deal Brexit would be an “Armageddon scenario”, and we should add the following to that: Panasonic is to move its European headquarters from London to Amsterdam in October; Unilever said on 11 September that it was going to end its dual Anglo-Dutch structure and make Rotterdam its main headquarters; and Jaguar Land Rover has written to the Prime Minister to say that no deal would put “tens of thousands” of jobs at risk. On science and research, the Government’s own technical notes state that UK institutions would no longer be eligible for three Horizon 2020 funding lines and no deal will cost the UK research £520 million a year and lack of collaboration with our scientists and friends across the globe.

No deal would also have an impact on our security. The National Police Coordination Centre warns that the

We have to be careful, however, that we do not superimpose a London-based, non-governmental organisation definition of environmentalism on to the country beyond. I am sure that that is not the Secretary of State’s intent, but there is a danger that we cast farmers and farming as detrimental to the environment when actually so much of the good that happens in our countryside is the work of our farmers.",Human Impact

"We have heard some excellent contributions today, with important points being made on both sides of the House, and I will refer to as many of them as I can in the time available. As many Members have suggested, this is sadly a complacent Budget, and that accusation came not only from the Opposition during this debate. That complacency was perhaps at starkest in the Chancellor’s assessment of our country’s economic health, and I was surprised to hear that repeated by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. He is usually a stickler for detail, but he seemed to suggest this afternoon that the estimates underlying the Government’s plans could be revised upwards if a good deal was done with the EU. However, those estimates already presuppose that a deal along the lines advocated by his Prime Minister will be struck with the EU, a fact which is obviously being challenged by many Conservative Back Benchers.

The Government’s policy is damaging to our motor industry, to our environment and to the consumer, and the Government have missed this opportunity do something about it. I urge the Minister, who I think understands the issue, and is committed to keeping our motor industry in the forefront of international development, to impress on the Treasury that if we have a new Budget next year—and even if we do not—action must be taken urgently to remedy this situation and save our motor industry.",Economic

For example, one constituent, a woman working 25 hours per week as a cleaner, is a single parent to a young child in primary school, so she needs to be around for childcare. She had a change in circumstances, so was moved on to universal credit. There was a delay in her first payment as her claim was not processed correctly, so she had to resort to visiting a food bank. She received an advance payment, but now her claim settlement leaves her with too little to live on after paying her rent. She is much worse off after moving from tax credits to universal credit.

When it came to the last referendum, I was for leave—on balance, but I think that was the right decision. The truth of the matter is that it was not to do with what was on the side of a bus, but that most of our citizens have had to live with the EU over several decades. There was just that general feeling that the EU was not very responsive to their needs. The British people have a certain native common sense that tells us that we could do better on our own.

I thank Mr Speaker for granting the debate. It is fair to say that his leadership in the past few weeks has been in stark contrast to that of the leaders of the Conservative party and the Labour party.

The Prime Minister described people discussing the possibility of a second Brexit referendum as somehow betraying the first vote or as being a direct challenge to democracy. I might be wrong, but I cannot recall another Prime Minister suggesting that giving the people their say on a matter is anti-democratic.

What we are debating today is the real failure to honour that first referendum. This Prime Minister has had the job of delivering on that result, and she has chosen her own path, which looks certain to lead to defeat. It is therefore this Prime Minister who has failed to honour the referendum result, and she has failed because she has been too scared to take on her European Research Group extreme Brexiteers in case they submit letters of no confidence to challenge her leadership.",Conflict
"Does the Home Secretary really think that the Home Office has the capacity to change its established ways of working and its unofficial targets, which it was clearly working towards and helped contribute to the Windrush scandal? Does he accept that on immigration, he cannot have it both ways? He cannot talk about an outward-looking, global Britain and meeting the needs of society and employers, while being part of a Government with a rhetoric of cracking down on migration—a rhetoric that, I might add, implicitly denigrates the parents of many of us in this House. He cannot be part of a Government with photocalls at airports to stress how they are cracking down on migrants. He cannot have it both ways. If he wishes to speak for a Government who are genuinely outward-looking, genuinely global in their outlook, he needs to move away definitively from that anti-migrant rhetoric and he needs to take steps to dismantle the hostile environment, much of which was implemented under this Government.",Moral Value
"Along with its humanitarian dimension, the particular focus of the motion is the need to seek an International Criminal Court referral through the United Nations. The Minister highlighted very well the complexities of getting such a referral, and we understand them, but we need to remind ourselves of some of the remarks that have been made, including “If not now, when?” If the Minister is not prepared to say when, for the reasons that he has explained—we fully appreciate the complexity and difficulty of international diplomacy—will he please make the commitment that he, and perhaps even the Foreign Secretary, will regularly report to the House, without our having to spend months trying to secure a Backbench debate that then gets delayed because of the wider crises that we face in this country, particularly given the uncertainties of Brexit and a potential no-deal situation.",Powerlessness

It is with regret that we return after the Christmas break with no progress from the Government on the withdrawal agreement and—even more remarkable—that we return with no Prime Minister in Parliament. She cannot be bothered to be here. We are now just days away from the deadline to get a deal to protect our economy and the Prime Minister is not in Parliament to explain her lack of progress. Why is the Prime Minister not responding to this urgent question?

It is now clear beyond doubt that the Prime Minister’s tactic is to run down the clock and deprive Parliament of any alternative to her Brexit proposals, bringing the prospect of a no deal closer. The SNP we will work across this House to get support for an alternative that is about having another EU referendum and letting the people take back control from this Government. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: get off the fence and join us. Stop this Government’s chaotic Brexit plan.",Conflict
"It is a new year, but it does feel like a groundhog statement, with exactly the same strategy as before: trying to force Parliament to choose between a bad deal for the UK and no deal at all, while talking up the even worse consequences of no deal. Further to the question asked by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), will the Secretary of State set out today how much was spent on the farcical exercise of having 100 lorries drive around Kent? What does he think that that does to the UK’s international reputation? Does he think that any other country is looking at that exercise and thinking that Brexit would be a great example to follow?",Conflict
"Finally, new clause 18 relates to migration levels. The political declaration confirms the intention to end free movement. This is a significant problem, and something the SNP has argued against at every possible opportunity. We do not think we should leave the EU, but if the UK is determined to leave the EU and have an immigration policy of its own creation, it needs one that does not have a £30,000 limit and it needs one that allows people to come to live and work in Scotland. If the UK Government are not willing to do that, they should devolve the powers to Scotland so that we can do that, or Scotland should have the chance to become an independent country again so, again, that we can have a better immigration policy.

The Scottish population is ageing faster than the population in the rest of the UK. In the UK, 15% of the agriculture and food sector is staffed by EU nationals. However, I have spoken to a local company in my area in which over 50% of the staff are EU nationals. In Scotland as a whole, 7% of our citizens are international migrants, and the percentage of people born outside the UK is far higher in Aberdeen.",Human Impact
"In the referendum campaign on our membership of the European Union, I supported and indeed voted remain. However, the argument of my colleagues who voted and campaigned for leave that I found most powerful and most emotionally impactful was that Parliament is sovereign and should take control of all the decisions that affect the lives of my constituents. That was the argument that the leave campaign made that I found the most difficult to resist and the most difficult to say was worth compromising for the sake of our membership of the European Union. It is therefore somewhat extraordinary that the very same people who made that argument so eloquently and effectively during the referendum campaign should somehow have the temerity to criticise me or other hon. and right hon. Members for doing what we believe is right in the interests of our constituents and in the national interest.",Moral Value
"The other point is the practical reality, which we have seen today and yesterday: the idea that the Prime Minister or anybody else was going to get away with freezing Parliament out of that decision in July 2020 is misconceived. We were always going to have a say on that, because it is such an important position. So the proposition on the table is not altered. The Brexit Secretary did not answer substantively on Monday because the December summit does not really take us anywhere: further clarifications may be possible but they are still long awaited, the Northern Ireland paper is a bringing together of existing commitments that does not change anything, and Parliament was always going to find a way of having a say in July 2020 as to which option we take.",Powerlessness
"If the Prime Minister’s deal is rejected, it will be for Parliament to reach a conclusion on how to proceed. I profoundly hope that we can, because if we are unable to do so and this House cannot reach a resolution on these matters, the possibility of a further referendum will undoubtedly arise—something I believe profoundly to be most undesirable. A large cohort of our constituents will feel that a second referendum tramples on their democratic rights and is an attempt by a complacent establishment to make off with the referendum result. As a matter of fact, I do not think the result would be likely to change in the event of a second referendum.

Parliament must now seek to reach an agreement on how best to proceed. Only if we find ourselves incapable of reaching any agreement should we consider the option of going back to our constituents to seek their further guidance.",Moral Value
"The referendums of 1975 and 2016 have much in common. Ted Heath, the then Prime Minister, had taken us into the common market in 1972 without a people’s vote, so Harold Wilson promised a referendum after he delivered renegotiated terms. The British people went for it, and he won the 1974 election and the remain result in the consequential referendum. Fast forward to 2015, David Cameron, who was becoming terrified of the threat posed by Nigel Farage and UKIP, must have looked back in history and thought it would be a good idea to imitate Harold Wilson by promising a referendum in the forthcoming election. To be fair, David Cameron was successful in that his policy secured a Conservative majority for the first time since 1992. The first part of Mr Cameron’s cunning plan worked, but the difference was that it all went wrong for Mr Cameron because he was no Harold Wilson and was completely unable to persuade the British people to do what was in Britain’s best interest.",Conflict

The TUC has declared that it cannot support a deal that fails to protect rights at work, jobs, and peace in Northern Ireland. It has drawn attention to the weakness of the Political Declaration, and the fact that it is not even legally binding. Working people have no way of knowing what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will really look like, and what impact it will have on their lives. The only certainty seems to be that this Brexit deal will make the country poorer, as is shown by the Government’s own economic analysis, with GDP falling by about 3.9% and every region in the UK being worse off.",Human Impact

I want to cut the food miles. I want to see more of our food being produced and sold domestically. Our domestic market share has plunged seriously during the time we have been in the European Union.

She was right to say that we should be proud of the record of this House over many centuries in establishing a defence of and a commitment to the rights of workers. That gives us cause to be proud around the world, certainly in Europe. We should be determined to continue that tradition. It is fair to reflect that this has involved Governments led by her party and Governments led by my party. The Labour party introduced the minimum wage and the Conservative party introduced the national living wage. Going back to previous generations in Parliament in different centuries, this House has always taken an active view in these matters. The amendment that she and her hon. Friends have tabled is entirely in accordance with that. Far from, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon) put it, involving a ceding of those decisions to the European Union, what is attractive about the contribution that has been made is that it firmly gives to this House the opportunity to make a sovereign decision on how we want to act on the opportunities that might exist to constantly upgrade and strengthen workers’ rights.

As ever, we need to look very carefully at its implications and drafting, but I am hopeful that it will be possible for us to accept it.

The amendment rightly mentions the environment. We have no intention of lowering our ambitious environmental protections after we leave the EU. We have a duty to continue the leadership we have exercised on that in Europe and across the world. It seems to me that we also have a responsibility, given that time is running out before 29 March, to take advantage of the availability of a means of preventing a damaging no-deal Brexit. It is difficult for investors around the world to understand why the most rudimentary trade terms available between any nations on earth should govern our relationship with the rest of the European Union.",Moral Value

My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) made it clear in his typically enjoyable speech that the issues of the Northern Ireland border remain totally unresolved. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) made the vital point—I have no doubt that many Conservative Members agree with him—that it remains the case that the deal on the table delivers no control of our laws, no control of our borders, and no control of our money. In fact, it cedes control to Europe by giving us no say on those issues.",Conflict

This is not the time to take a stand against the pragmatic reality of what is on the table. I credit my right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for recognising that.

Right now, what business needs is some certainty. With only 73 days to go before we leave the EU, firms are already having to take costly decisions to stockpile goods and parts and, in some cases, to mothball production capacity. The cost of that hits their bottom line and ultimately results in them having to let people go. The car industry, for which the EU is the principal market, is particularly hurt.

All the choices made along the way—choices made willingly and wilfully by the Prime Minister—have led us not reluctantly but inexorably to the place we are in today.

It is unforgivable that we have lost a whole month to a simple running down of the clock because the Prime Minister was afraid of losing the vote, as she will inevitably this evening anyway.

Surely any Government would be strengthened in trying to renegotiate Brexit by being given a fresh mandate from the people to follow their chosen course.

Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) to reply to the House, when my question was to the Prime Minister.

We find out from journalists and the Irish Government that the Prime Minister is apparently heading to Strasbourg this evening, or not heading to Strasbourg this evening, hours before a meaningful vote is due. The Prime Minister was clear and categorical on 26 February. She said:

“I want to reassure the House by making three further commitments. First, we will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest”—

there are still 24 hours to go, so who knows? She also committed to a vote on no deal by 13 March and a vote on whether to extend article 50 by 14 March. She then concluded:

"I need to be straight with the House: a no-deal Brexit would deliver a significant short to medium-term reduction in the productive capacity of the British economy. Our economy is operating at near full capacity, so any fiscal and monetary response would have to be carefully calibrated not to simply cause inflation, compounding the effect of any movement in the exchange rate on the price of goods in our shops. While fiscal and monetary intervention might help to smooth our path to a post-Brexit economy, both could only be temporary and neither would allow us to avoid the effects of a relatively smaller economy nor the pain of restructuring. The idea that there is some simple, readily available fix that can be deployed to avoid the consequences of a no-deal Brexit is, I am afraid, just wrong.",Economic

I sense the Chancellor’s frustration with the House’s inability to approve the withdrawal agreement, but does he agree that this means that many of the forecasts are obviously going to have to be revisited as the Brexit scenario plays itself out over the next few months?

The Chancellor mentioned the forthcoming CSR and education spending. May I urge him also to think very clearly and closely about spending on further education colleges, which is another critical part of improving productivity in our country?

The Budget report recently produced by the Treasury Committee said that the Chancellor was effectively disregarding the fiscal objective to run a balanced budget in the mid-2020s, and the OBR has said today that the target will not be met again. So does he intend, by the next Budget, to ensure that the existing fiscal charter will be updated for this Parliament?",Economic

I am not sure what the names of the other wings are, but I was taken with that: the party’s members are talking about a headbanger wing, which must be a sizeable proportion of the party. While we are talking about no deal, I note the words of the Dutch Prime Minister, who is alleged to have said that a decision to vote for no deal was

“like the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way”.

It is unusual for the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress to speak with one voice, but they are both against a no-deal Brexit. This time it is far worse than 2008, because the Government would be consciously and deliberately inflicting the outcome on the UK economy and, by extension, on our communities.

The Prime Minister will stand in front of Downing Street on Independence Day having to say to the country, “Do not worry, we will manage all the traffic jams. Do not worry, we will make sure you get your medicine. I have now sent the Trade Minister to go and negotiate all those many deals. Do not worry, everything will be alright.” She will have to do that because, of all the negotiable options available, the Government have chosen the one that causes the most disruption to people’s lives.

Three international events are important. First, President Tusk said that we need to vote on the withdrawal agreement again.

You might like to address the matter in answer to a point of order later. Secondly, the Le Point magazine website put out a report at 1.6 pm that President Macron had stated that unless there is “a clear project”—that was the translation—France intends to veto any extension.

As soon as we have a response from the EU Council, I will be able to update the House on when we can bring forward a meaningful vote and a debate next week. But it is certainly the Prime Minister’s intention to do so. Likewise, in terms of bringing forward the statutory instrument, hon.

Today we are told that this is because Northern Ireland is not prepared, yet all the preparations that are made by central Government apply to Northern Ireland.

I note that since I put my amendment down the Prime Minister has become an enthusiastic convert to the notion of indicative votes. In the statement she made from Downing Street, she said, of the process she is now, as we speak, engaging in by talking to the Leader of the Opposition to try to find a way forward, that if we cannot agree on an approach

“we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.”

I think that that was a very significant announcement, because the Government had talked in general terms about giving the House such an opportunity.

The final of my three points is perhaps even more relevant to this particular proposal: it is tradition that the Government have vested in them Crown prerogative, and the Prime Minister and Ministers act on behalf of the Crown in all international negotiations.

The Brussels authorities—the European Union—do not wish to negotiate with groups of MPs. They wish to negotiate with the UK Government, because it is the UK Government who are the signatory to the treaty and the UK Government who have sought the agreement of the EU to our withdrawal—or indeed to our automatic withdrawal under article 50 should no agreement be reached.",Powerlessness
"I am conscious that those on the Front Benches need to speak, so I shall make my final point.

It is really important for people to come together, both as part of this process and in how we go forward, because the challenges that we face from the threat of no deal are very significant. Three years on from the referendum, the biggest problem for all of us is that so little has been done to heal the national Brexit divide or to bring people together. This is a major constitutional change, and, to be honest, if we do not make the effort to bring people together, whatever we conclude today, tomorrow or next week will not last because we will not have done the work to build consensus. We all know that there is no consensus on the best way forward at the moment—we hope we can reach it, but at the moment there is no agreement—but let us at least sustain our agreement on ruling out the worst way forward. I commend the Bill to the House.",Moral Value
"I also invite the Committee to reflect on what this House looks like tonight as we discuss such highly technical issues. The British people expect us to be discussing the big principles of whether we should leave without a deal on WTO terms or sign up to the withdrawal agreement. This particular debate, however, seems particularly obscure and unavailable to voters. It will make this House look particularly out of touch, especially because the Bill is somewhat otiose.

I have argued for some time with colleagues on the Conservative Benches that the Prime Minister has demonstrated little intention of ever leaving without a withdrawal agreement. The fact that the Government have spewed out a whole raft of information basically about why they do not want to leave without a deal underlines that point. I therefore think that the Bill is unnecessary.

In my comments to my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash), Chair of the European Scrutiny Committee, I pointed out that the Bill is also unenforceable. Just look at the wording of subsection (4), which is that

“the Prime Minister must seek an extension of the period specified Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union”.",Moral Value

Amendment proposed: No. 22, page 2, line 3, at end insert—

“() Nothing in this section prevents a Minister of the Crown from seeking, or agreeing to, an extension of the period specified in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union otherwise than in accordance with this section.”—(Stephen Barclay.)

This amendment ensures that the Bill does not limit the powers that a Minister of the Crown would otherwise have to seek, or agree to, an extension of the Article 50(3) period.

"Paragraphs (12) and (17) of regulation 2 remove the requirement to refer decisions made in the past three years by other EU member states in respect of these regulations. It seems entirely sensible to refer to precedents established by other countries, particularly where those countries ostensibly operate the same regime as our own. Perhaps the Minister can clarify whether the Government intend to continue to refer to any such precedents in any future decisions made by the Secretary of State. Indeed, paragraph (12) removes the EU from the list of competent bodies whose findings should be referenced, so I would be grateful if the Minister clarified the Government’s intention in that regard.

Paragraph (17) of regulation 2 removes the obligation of the Commission and member states to develop best practice approaches, alongside paragraph (31), which clearly ends the UK’s participation in the anti-torture co-ordination group. Although the Government might consider that to be necessary once we have withdrawn from the EU, it would be helpful if he set out how the Government intend to continue dialogue with our international partners, particularly in the EU, on common approaches to controlling torture goods.",None

I put the case that there is only a single tier of EU membership, with no conditionality attached beyond existing treaty obligations. The Council conclusions are clear that during the course of the extension the UK will continue to hold full membership rights. In turn, I assured my fellow leaders that the UK will continue to be bound by all our ongoing obligations as a member state, including the duty of sincere co-operation. The United Kingdom plays a responsible and constructive role on the world stage, and we always will. That is the kind of country we are.",Moral Value

Let me make clear that Labour opposes the idea of passing the withdrawal agreement Bill without an agreed deal. That would put the cart before the horse, and Labour will therefore vote against the Bill’s Second Reading. How on earth does the Secretary of State think that a Bill to implement a deal that is not before the House can be passed in two weeks’ time—or is this about keeping the Prime Minister in office for another week, and giving her a lifeline for today’s meeting of the 1922 Committee?",Conflict
"In advance of the withdrawal agreement Bill could we possibly have a debate about masochism, Mr Speaker, because it seems to me that the very definition of May-ite Conservatism is to do the same thing over and over again expecting a different result? It is a bewildering condition that involves delusion, deafness and self-flagellation—which they have obviously found a taste for—eventually leading to schism, paralysis and then political death. The idea that the Prime Minister will somehow get it through this time is almost like abandoning all sense of reason as Members are all rushing to tell her that they are not prepared to support her on this withdrawal agreement Bill. Her only hope is to get her comrades in the Labour party to abstain on all this, but I think I heard the shadow Secretary of State for Brexit saying today that Labour will not abstain and I hope that will be the case.

Another week on, and the men in grey underpants are still camped outside No. 10, trying to get the recalcitrant occupant to leave. Ultimatum after ultimatum is delivered, to no effect, and timetables are discussed, to no impact. I believe that another one is being discussed this morning.

The Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House, the International Trade Secretary and the Treasury Chief Secretary all made it clear that they would not tolerate a deal that included a customs union, while Tory leadership contender after Tory leadership contender took it in turns to make it absolutely clear that any compromise deal would not be honoured. Therefore, no matter what the Prime Minister offers, it is clear that no compromise would survive the upcoming Tory leadership contest. The multiple leaks reported from the Cabinet yesterday show that the Prime Minister could not even get the compromise deal she wanted through her own Cabinet, and it is clear that the shrunken offer that emerged satisfied no one—not her own Back Benchers, not the Democratic Unionist party and not the Official Opposition either.

Unfortunately, Labour Front Benchers were unable yesterday to deliver enough votes from their own MPs to begin the process of stopping us crashing out of the EU without a deal. The Leader of the House, who is a good man and will always do his best, has said that the Government take the view that Parliament should not be prorogued by whoever is our next Prime Minister, to the exclusion of Parliament, so that we crash out without a deal, so the Government apparently think that would be the wrong thing for any future Prime Minister to do.

If a Member on the shadow Minister’s own Benches can be honest about that, she should be equally candid. In answer to her question, between those two options, I think no Brexit is worse than no deal. No deal would be disruptive, and I have been clear about that to colleagues in my party, but the shadow Minister has consistently voted against a deal, and it is the deal that would have secured the interests of businesses such as the chemicals industry.",Conflict

I have been able to go, for example, to the annual conference of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, and anybody who has gone to look at cross-border issues will realise just how catastrophic a no-deal Brexit would be.

"In truth it is neither, but this controversy reflects the evolving and changing nature of the relationship between Parliament, Government and people. That is a permanent evolution in our constitution, and two measures in particular have led to a substantial sea change in the relationship between Parliament and Government. The first is the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which was sold to a perhaps rather unsuspecting House as a means of limiting Executive power, but in the event of a statutory no-confidence vote the Act is silent on what happens afterwards, except for the 14-day period. The Prime Minister may no longer be able to call a general election, but he is no longer obliged to resign either—at least not for 14 days. That has the effect of strengthening the incumbency of a sitting Prime Minister. Of course, that is exactly what it was intended to do—it was intended to cement the coalition in place—but it has left the House with the option to wound rather than kill Governments.

The second reason is that many in the UK have failed to grasp that it is we who are leaving the EU. That means that it is a negotiation between us. We have never really understood the EU or its arguments, believing that a negotiation was a series of demands from the United Kingdom, not a negotiation.

If not, will the Government either propose a different basis for negotiations with the EU, or make it clear that they will seek an immediate extension, as required under the Benn Act, on 19 October.

A debate on the place of Britain in the world cannot happen without considering the impact that Brexit will have on the UK economy.

This would directly threaten thousands of jobs, and could make the sector among the hardest hit by Brexit in the whole of Scotland—Scottish fishing sold out by the Conservatives yet again. That is the stark reality, as opposed to the bluster of a UK Tory Government who once again treat Scotland as an afterthought. Well, we in the SNP will not stand for it.",Human Impact

This very clearly flies in the face of that, because it seeks the approval of the House without the legislative stages having been approved.

I understand entirely why the Government are trying to do this, because of course it would negate the whole effect of the amendment today, rather than moving us on to the Second Reading of the withdrawal implementation Bill, as I had hoped and expected, but I wanted to point those things out to you, Mr Speaker, because I think they are material when deciding whether it is orderly.",None

They are increasingly exasperated with all political parties and at the ability of the UK political system to take a decision on this matter. As far as the EU Governments are concerned, they want this brought to an orderly conclusion as soon as possible in a way that does as little harm as possible to the interests of the EU27. That interest includes the future constructive and close relationship that they—like, I believe, most in the House—wish to see between this country and the continuing European Union.",Powerlessness

I recognise that not everyone voted on economic grounds. Indeed, yes, there will be a short-term boost to the economy because of investment decisions that have been deferred through the process so far, but that is not the issue. That is not the measure of success. It is about the next 10, 20 and 30 years.

"It is a pleasure to follow the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mike Hill) and I share a number of the assessments that he made in his contribution, because as the House pursues our debate on the Queen’s Speech, it is becoming ever more apparent that the casualty of a Tory Brexit will be Britain’s national health service.

The NHS is our greatest national asset; it is the product of the fusion of radical and enlightened minds in the last century that gave us healthcare for all based on need, not means. But now, in this century, the NHS is in great peril from a toxic combination of chronic underfunding and withdrawal from the EU, and responding to very different challenges from those when it was first created so long ago.

Notwithstanding the announcements in the Queen’s Speech, let us be very clear that the NHS is not in receipt of the resources that it needs to be effective. That was discussed only yesterday at the Health and Social Care Committee, when we had with us the Secretary of State and we talked about the backlog of £6 billion in NHS repairs alone, so an announcement of half that really is no cause for celebration. We heard from the Health Foundation, and its assessment of the Queen’s Speech funding announcement says that",Human Impact

The Prime Minister told the House on Saturday there would be no checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, yet yesterday the Brexit Secretary confirmed to the Lords European Union Committee that Northern Irish businesses sending goods to Britain would have to complete export declaration forms.

We are here because, in the 1970s, the UK was the dirty man of Europe—or the dirty person, as I think we should probably call ourselves—and we pumped raw sewage into the sea.

"Despite the Secretary of State’s energetic assertions, make no mistake: the Prime Minister’s deal is disastrous for workers’ rights. Scottish workers and industry now face the spectre of Tory trade deals to lower environmental and other vital standards. The Tories can never be trusted with workers’ rights; their record speaks for itself, and anyone who believes otherwise is sorely deluded. The Prime Minister bought off Labour votes for his awful deal by pledging “the highest possible standards”. Days later, that promise, like so many others, lay in tatters.

EU law and courts provide their own backstop against UK workers’ rights being weakened. We know that this Government are planning to diverge on the key regulations post Brexit. Is not it the case that the only way to guarantee workers’ rights and avoid them being watered down is to stay in the EU? As the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has pointed out:

“Loss of oversight from, and recourse to, the European Court of Justice will remove…protection from UK citizens”.

It is the military equivalent of the higher officer’s intentions—how our individual decisions and missions are knitted together to give a stronger and greater effect. Our party wins elections because it is willing to change, advance and adapt, while still being anchored to its core values.

The adjective “conservative” does not imply that something is progressive or reforming, but let us to go back to what Edmund Burke, one of the founding voices of Conservatism, said. He spoke of the need to reform in order to conserve what is important to us: community bonds and shared values. It is for that reason that I was so cheered by the Prime Minister using his first speech outside No. 10 to thank those who lent us their support, saying that it would not be taken for granted.

"Throughout my lifetime, the result of the general election in Scotland has not affected the result across the UK. The Prime Minister has always been chosen by voters in England and Wales. Until 2015, however, the majority party elected in Scotland to Westminster was, for whatever reason, committed to itself one day being part of a Government of the United Kingdom. Although there was a stark democratic deficit, which led to the campaign for and creation of Scotland’s devolved Parliament, it was fair to say that the majority was bound to accept the UK result. Since 2015 however, the majority of Members returned to this place by constituencies in Scotland have a different view. We believe that if the United Kingdom cannot and will not deliver on the priorities of our constituents, we must have the opportunity to choose an alternative path.

Some time ago, immediately after the 2016 referendum, I asked what the Government would do to ensure that regional voices and concerns were heard as part of the Brexit negotiations. The answer that I received from the Prime Minister was nothing, and I have little hope that it will be any more encouraging today.",Powerlessness

It is of course the case that it is in the nature of devolution that the Administrations have no power, so I suggest to the Secretary of State that the inclusion of that provision is at the very least somewhat otiose.

It would be bizarre to allow an employment tribunal or even a High Court judge sitting at first instance to, on the face of it, have the power to disapply EU law in a way that might not be consistent with the ruling of the higher court in previous cases. I am sure that that is not the intention, but the wording as it stands, without more being said, seems to open up the risk that that could happen.

This is about an immigration policy in the control of a British Government, not subject to EU laws, EU policies and EU alignment. That is a fundamental shift and a fundamental change. This system is about taking back control, as the British Government have said, of our borders and ensuring that we can get the brightest and best through a tiered, points-based approach, as outlined in the policy statement.

The system will end the reliance on low-skilled workers and, importantly, the hon. Lady should join the Government in welcoming our collective mission to ensure that people are paid higher wages. We want a high-skilled economy, not a low-pay economy. As for social care, social care is not at all about low-skilled work. People working in social care should be paid properly, and it is right that businesses and employers invest in skills to provide the necessary compassionate care.

It is all about our sovereignty,” but it is not all about sovereignty; it is all about people’s jobs, livelihoods and future. The people who voted to leave the EU did not vote to leave their jobs.

Finally, I am reassured to a limited extent that the Secretary of State is again using warm words about the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon and, indeed, the lagoon in north Wales. Climate change is really hitting us for six. We know that 80% of fossil fuels cannot be used if we are to avoid irreversible climate change, and the spot price of oil is deflated due to excess production and fracking, which produces enormous amounts of excess methane that is making climate change even worse. Fossil fuel companies are basically sitting on stranded assets, and the financial markets will belatedly move out of that sector, so we need to invest now in green, climate change-compatible energy projects, such as the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon.",Economic

will apply. So can the Minister confirm that that will include rules of origin checks, safety and security checks and import declarations, and if so, where and how will those checks take place? There is no mention in the document published today of a trusted trader scheme, which is surely essential for ensuring the free flow of goods without tariffs from Great Britain into Northern Ireland that we all want to see.",Economic

We also think that in the context of an unprecedented global pandemic and a catastrophic economic recession, which might turn out to be the worst in 300 years, it is frankly irresponsible to think that things can be done properly within that timeframe.

That view is widely held by those who have the misfortune to watch and comment upon the British Government’s conduct of the negotiations, which includes the ill-judged and rather petulant letter sent by Mr Frost to Mr Barnier last month. That is widely seen as having been something of a nadir in the British Government’s approach to the negotiations.",Conflict

"Of course the Government will say that the impact on the creative industries and people’s ability to get visas to travel to work, with a good system of immigration that helps them, will be subject to reciprocity through agreements with the EU. But for creatives, this is not a zero-sum game: it is not about us benefiting, versus others. We will benefit, too, if EU nationals are able to work here: think of the great orchestras and the artists who display their work in our galleries.

Therefore, we need to know now what the Government’s intentions are and we need to secure new clause 37 so that we can monitor the impact of their policies. I ask the Minister: what kind of future do they envisage for our creative industries? What kind of reciprocity do they foresee on social security arrangements and other practical limitations on the ability of those working in the creative industries and the arts to work elsewhere in Europe? How do they plan to underpin the ability of some of our finest artists, our best musicians and our most talented creatives to work across the continent, and the ability of their partners in the creative pursuits to work here?

Indeed, on 8 June in this very place, the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) made a strong and eloquent case for retaining remote working and hybrid arrangements, because they were working properly and should be brought back “in full”. I do not believe for a minute that he believes that it should be one rule for us and another for other people, but I do agree with him that remote working does actually work well, and our negotiating teams have been demonstrating that every day with their continued important work on exiting the European Union.",Conflict

The Prime Minister signed it and described it then as a “negotiating triumph”. Not only was it a negotiating triumph, but, as he told the electorate in December, it was “oven-ready” and good to go. He told the electorate, “Vote for me and I will get Brexit done”, and for reasons that I will never fathom, the people of England did. So in December, flushed with a huge majority, he led every single Tory MP through the Lobby to support his deal. However, the Government now want unilaterally to move the goalposts and renege on what they signed up to at the start of the year.

Just after the 2014 referendum, we were told we were a partnership of equals, but we were then told immediately afterwards that we are part of the United Kingdom, not a partner in it. The Bill makes that explicit in the eyes of the people of Scotland.

I won Stirling from the Conservatives with 51% of the vote precisely because I am in favour of the rule of law and international solidarity, as demonstrated by the multilateral, binding, voluntary solidarity of the European Union.

That the draft Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, which were laid before this House on 13 October, be approved.

In recent years, the EU has introduced, through the ecodesign directive and the energy-labelling framework regulation a suite of product-specific regulations. Ecodesign regulations are all about minimising the cost and environmental impact of products used in homes and businesses by setting minimum energy performance standards. Energy labelling regulations provide consumers with information about a given product’s energy performance to allow them to make informed purchasing decisions. In 2020, those policies will save households approximately £100 on their annual energy bills, and they will also lead to greenhouse gas emissions savings of 8 million tonnes of CO2 while driving innovation and competitiveness in business.

The aims of the statutory instrument are relatively straightforward.

This Bill will help us support those commitments by providing legal certainty for the customs, VAT and excise systems in Northern Ireland after the end of the transition period.

If I may, I will start with the customs elements of the Bill. The House will know that the UK is a single customs territory, with article 4 of the Northern Ireland protocol giving a clear legal commitment to this.

That was not clever negotiating tactics and it was not toughness—it was reckless, and, I am afraid, it was revealing about the character of the Government.",Moral Value

Their no-show here today is not surprising, though, given that their colleagues in the Lords sat on their hands yesterday with regard to amendments seeking to keep state aid a devolved matter and Lord Thomas’s amendment challenging the Government’s clauses on direct spending in devolved areas. This is happening in direct breach of the vow that the then leader of the Labour party signed. But Labour does not care. It is happy to wheel out Gordon Brown to talk about federalism when independence is riding high, but when it comes to defending the existing devolved settlement, it is missing in action. This is a shameful state of affairs, and it falls to the SNP to defend devolution. We are doomed to fail, but that will simply further reinforce the case for independence.",Conflict

If we stick to the level playing field, there are no tariffs and quotas, but if we do not, British businesses, British workers and British consumers will bear the cost. The Prime Minister has not escaped that dilemma; he has negotiated a treaty that bakes it in. This poses the central question for future Governments and Parliaments: do we build up from this agreement to ensure that the UK has high standards and that our businesses are able to trade as freely as possible in the EU market with minimal disruption; or do we choose to lower standards and slash protections, and in that way put up more barriers for our businesses to trade with our nearest and most important partners?",Economic

Throughout this awful pandemic, I have seen the true nature of global Britain shining through. I have seen it in our diverse communities in Vauxhall coming together to help their neighbours and to keep our public services running.

It is about how we work with others who share those values to establish and maintain a rules-based international order that protects those values.

Sadly, what we saw last week in the United States shows us how fragile the value of democracy can be when it is under pressure from populism and nationalism, fuelled by messages disseminated on social media. At the current point for the United Kingdom, post Brexit, dealing with covid and yet to deal with the societal and economic impacts of that, it is absolutely imperative that we reject any push towards nationalism and isolationism and that we recognise the importance of global Britain.

Finally, although it is not a consequence of the trade and co-operation agreement, the end of the transition period and the fact that we have left both the customs union and the single market does mean that there is some additional administration accompanying exports to the EU.

As a Unionist, I keep on reminding people in Northern Ireland that the support that businesses have had, as well as furlough payments that workers are still getting, self-employed payments and so on, are owed to the fact that we are part of the fifth biggest nation in the world and, without the support of the Exchequer in the United Kingdom, we would not have been able to find a way through.

"In common with other hon. Members who have spoken tonight and on other occasions, the Liberal Democrats support the broad principles of the Bill. It is sensible, at a time of geopolitical uncertainty and increasingly globalised trade, to have provisions for the Secretary of State to intervene in business transactions where those transactions may have a bearing on national security. It is important, however, that the parameters of such a Bill are carefully drawn to ensure both that the transactions that may pose a threat can be caught, and that undue constraint is not placed on transactions that ought to be able to proceed freely.

The concerns raised about the Bill have focused on the fact that many of the definitions in it can be drawn too widely, and that the powers of the Secretary of State to call in transactions can be triggered too easily. That creates an environment of uncertainty for investors, as a wide variety of activities come into the scope of the Secretary of State’s powers. That will potentially act as a brake on investment, and at a crucial moment, when we are looking to strike new deals with global partners to replace the trade we are losing as a result of leaving the European Union.",Economic

The provision would also cover events, including funfairs, which have had a very tough year, with many traditional fairs up and down the country being cancelled. Maintaining the VAT reduction could help to provide a much-needed stimulus to an events, tourism and hospitality sector that is crying out for such a boost.

The Minister has set out clearly that he believes that it did not, but I believe there is an equally valid argument that aspects of it did work, although of course it was not without its pitfalls and flaws. The best example was the 2015 general election, which took place five years after the 2010 general election. It worked in the sense of holding the coalition Government to that timetable. However, I would argue that we could also say that the 2017 general election proves that the Act worked, because there were clauses within it for having an early election and those were gone through in the 2017 election.

The debate about whether the Act works probably centres around whether the 2017 to 2019 Parliament worked. That probably highlights the flaws in the Act. The fact that the Act said the Prime Minister could control the date of the election was, I would argue, one of the main sticking points of the Act, because at that point the Opposition felt the Prime Minister might abuse the Act to leave the European Union with no deal.

The city’s contribution to the UK economy for the sector accounts for 50% of the sector’s economic output, but, interestingly, Scotland ranks just behind London and the south-east; it is a very well-established financial centre.

Even the leader of the Scottish National party in Westminster, the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford), is looking chirpy at the thought of having that degree of control.

Our Procurement Bill will make life easier for small businesses. I think it was my hon.

Ultimately, there is a clear choice on this Queen’s Speech. It is a choice brought into sharper relief by the inflation that we currently face and a choice faced by previous generations in this House and in this country: do we wish to go down the false path of socialism?

We have heard some fantastic speeches, and I thank all those who have contributed positively.

It is not a secret that I am very pleased to be the MP for Strangford, and it is probably one of the highlights of my life. It is always a pleasure to reflect my constituents’ views in this Chamber, and the majority of them are very clear in their opposition to the border down the Irish sea and the restrictions it imposes. Ninety-nine per cent. of businesses in my constituency have expressed concern.

I think the hon. Member for North Down (Stephen Farry) said businesses are doing well. My constituency is not far away from his, but he is in a different world. I do not understand what he is on about. At last week’s Northern Ireland questions, the Secretary of State said 200 businesses have stopped trading between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. Well, at least 200 businesses in my area alone are not trading today, so I suspect the number is greater.",Economic
"I fear that this Bill is a kind of displacement activity from the core task of doing whatever we can to negotiate a better protocol deal for Northern Ireland. I also fear that it risks creating an impression to Unionism that a black-and-white solution is available when the reality is that, once this Bill has been dragged through the Lords and the courts and after EU responses and reprisals, compromise will ultimately be needed. Our sole focus should be on how we shift the EU into a negotiation to get the changes needed for Northern Ireland and from the right hon. Member’s party.

We risk toxifying further the discussions we are having with the EU and member states, and we risk prolonging instability for Northern Ireland business, not to mention putting the whole of the UK at risk of trade and tariff reprisals. We also risk further entrenching the view of many middle-ground voters in Northern Ireland that the desire to finish Brexit by removing the protocol is against their best interests. This issue of winning hearts and minds is important to bear in mind as we seek to persuade and cajole people to stick with the Union.",Conflict

When it comes to the EU and our trading relationship—it is nice to hear from the Labour party that it does not want to rerun the Brexit arguments—it is very clear that there is now a growing faction on the Labour Benches that wants to do one thing and one thing only, which is to take us back into the single market.",Conflict
"It says a lot that simply describing those values sounds like a criticism of the Conservative party, the current Prime Minister and almost certainly the next. It is most certainly a criticism of the Bill, which not only breaks convention—the law—but betrays our values as a Parliament and as a country. The Bill exists because the Prime Minister was not honest about the full nature of the Brexit deal. That was followed by a manifesto that promised that his deal was “oven-ready” and vowed to the public that there would be no renegotiations of it.

It is easy for Ministers to dismiss my criticisms, because they are the words of an Opposition spokesman, so how about the words of one of their leadership contenders—of someone running to be their next leader and our Prime Minister? All the contenders have trashed the Tory record in office, so let us take just the most recent example. This morning, the right hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt) said:

“The British people…are fed up with us not delivering, they are fed up with unfulfilled promises”.

As my right hon. and learned Friend mentioned, there is no long-term solution to be reached by a unilateral attempt to impose one side’s will on a shared international treaty. Of course, there is no reason to think that this will change the EU’s behaviour in relation of Northern Ireland. Why should it? The EU’s concern is that the UK has been untrustworthy, and far from allaying that concern, the Bill actively reinforces it. If the EU made a concession in response—if by chance it struck a new agreement with the UK on the basis of the pressure supposedly conferred by this legislation—why should it believe that the UK would then abide by such an agreement? That whole rationale would already have been destroyed. Of course, for reasons already discussed today, this is merely the beginning of the potential trouble involved.",Conflict

Although some in the House will point out that the Government signed up to the protocol, I welcome the fact that the Government recognise that the protocol is not working, that it is harmful to Northern Ireland and that changes need to be made. That is very important.

We believe that the democratic deficit needs to be addressed. The European Union has so far shown an unwillingness to introduce proposals that would meet the United Kingdom’s concerns in that regard.

So the question the Committee reasonably ask of the Minister is: what is this power and what do Ministers want it for? If I heard the Minister correctly, he said that the clause was there merely to ensure that Ministers acted lawfully. What is this “conduct”? I ask because “engage in conduct” is, as the very helpful House of Commons Library note says,

We know that that has not always been done as fully as it should have been in the past, and as we debate the Bill in this Committee we have the opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to ensuring that that does happen in future.

It is also important to recognise, when we look at the important progress that Northern Ireland is making in its economic development and in bouncing back from the covid pandemic, that the European Union is making a reasonable point about the need to ensure that we carry out the relevant checks on goods and products that are traded in and out of that single market—a point that we have an equivalence for in our own United Kingdom single market. There is a lot of history to that. The United Kingdom has historically been notorious, as a member of the single market, for not carrying out the checks on goods and services that we were committed to carrying out as part of that single market.",Human Impact

The cost of financial advice is high, and the guidance itself can be very generic. There is, of course, access to the Money Advice Service and to Pension Wise, which I encourage constituents to use if they can, but the Bill gives us the opportunity to look once again at the financial advice market and to have more customised guidance because of how technology has evolved and the important role that the FCA’s regulatory sandbox plays in allowing people to experiment.",Economic

There are difficult decisions to be made about what is happening in Ukraine, about the fact that President Putin has nuclear weapons, about the chaos caused by Brexit, about gang crime, about the climate crisis, and about Ebola in Africa; and all that we know right now—unless the Leader of the House tells us otherwise—is that the Prime Minister is cowering under her desk and asking for it all to go away.

It is essential to resolve this matter now in order to move beyond Brexit and focus on pressing national issues such as housing, social mobility, and social care. This should be our objective. I do not support a compromise that will require reopening and renegotiation in the future. I have formed my view on the Chequers proposal and anticipate that colleagues will examine it further in the coming days. I leave Members to reflect on these remarks:",Conflict
"Finally, could we have a discussion on the removal of elites, specifically within political parties? This morning, I reviewed the definition of a coup, which is described as the sudden seizure of leadership or power and its replacement by other elites within the state structure. At present, there is almost a visible divide on the Opposition Benches between the two factions of the Labour party—a clear separation is evident. Those attempting the internal takeover appear to be the least effective coup plotters: lacking a clear plan, no apparent challenger, and displaying passive inactivity, with the unrealistic expectation that their Front-Bench team will resign on their own. I propose we hold this debate to consider whether they might draw lessons from historical precedent.",Conflict
"From the outset, I have stated that my objective is to reunite the nation.— [Official Report, 26 February 2019; Vol. 655, c. 167.]

I must reject that assertion. This process has not prioritized the national interest; rather, it has focused on maintaining the unity of the Conservative and Unionist party and prolonging the Prime Minister’s tenure.",Conflict
"It is clear that, unless the UK Government reverses its current stance, electrification will extend only as far as Cardiff. The European Commission considers extending electrification to Swansea to be significant for rail and transport connections across Europe, but this does not appear to be a priority for the UK Government. In summary, this illustrates one reason why my party advocates for full membership within the European Union rather than the current constitutional arrangement. While the EU emphasizes cooperation and investment across Europe, UK policy over recent years has increasingly focused on strengthening one region of the United Kingdom, namely London.",Conflict
"After the outcome of the referendum, the Government has been tasked with conducting negotiations regarding the withdrawal and the transition period, with further negotiations anticipated in the future. To date, the agreement has not secured parliamentary approval due to the presence of three conflicting factions around the Government: supporters of remaining, advocates for a complete exit, and the Labour party, whose unclear position lacks consensus even within its leadership. The majority of the public desires the Prime Minister to achieve success and for the agreement to be approved in order to secure the most advantageous terms in forthcoming arrangements.",Conflict
"Does the sequencing method in negotiations represent an example of employing best endeavours or engaging in negotiations in good faith? I contend that it does not. It is now apparent to most impartial analysts that the EU’s current stance on the Northern Ireland protocol is to use it as a bargaining tool in the discussions. In what way does this illustrate negotiating in good faith? This legislation will guarantee that Northern Ireland continues to be part of the UK’s customs territory and that businesses in Northern Ireland maintain unrestricted access to Great Britain markets. Nonetheless, I must record that further action is required concerning Northern Ireland, especially after hearing strong and persuasive contributions from Unionist colleagues today and on previous occasions.",Conflict
"The proposed date is incorrect because those supporting continued EU membership wish to utilize every chance to present a constructive argument for it. The UK Government is unable to present a cohesive argument for membership due to significant divisions within the Conservative party and Cabinet on this important matter, so it is essential to have a well-informed discussion and sufficient time for it. It would be inappropriate for the Prime Minister to invest extensive effort and time in consulting individually with the Heads of State of each EU country without appropriately considering the perspectives of the Governments throughout these islands.",Conflict
"Several individuals have expressed worries today regarding the limited examination and insufficient time allocated to consider this Bill. My right hon. Friend has noted that Scotland has been overlooked during this procedure—a country that voted substantially in favor of remaining in the EU. Does he agree with me that, amidst all this, there remains a tendency to conveniently overlook the fact that the referendum was decided by a very slim margin across the UK? The Electoral Commission has stated that electoral law was breached, yet this issue has been disregarded, leading me to question the validity of the result altogether.",Conflict
"I will proceed with the discussion, mindful that others also wish to contribute.

A further vote on the Prime Minister’s agreement was assured; however, recognising the lack of backing for her proposal, the Prime Minister has brought this matter forward in a manner that attempts to mislead Members into supporting her flawed agreement. Nonetheless, it remains the identical agreement that the House has rejected on two occasions. Mr Speaker, this agreement ought to be considered concluded. We are now presented with the conditions under which the Prime Minister seeks approval for withdrawal from the European Union, despite the absence of clarity regarding our future relationship. This represents a Brexit conducted without sufficient information.",Conflict
"I extend my congratulations to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) not only for obtaining this timely and significant debate but also for his speech and the manner in which he conducted himself despite encountering quite unacceptable behaviour, frankly, from Conservative Members.

I am grateful to Mr Speaker for allowing this debate to take place. It is accurate to state that his guidance over recent weeks has markedly differed from that of the leaders of both the Conservative and Labour parties.

The Prime Minister characterised those discussing the possibility of a second Brexit referendum as somehow betraying the initial vote or as directly opposing democracy. I may be mistaken, but I do not recall a Prime Minister previously suggesting that allowing the public to express their views on an issue is undemocratic.

The subject before us today concerns the genuine failure to uphold the result of the first referendum. This Prime Minister has been responsible for implementing that outcome, yet she has chosen a course that appears likely to result in failure. Consequently, it is this Prime Minister who has not honoured the referendum result, and this failure stems from her reluctance to confront her European Research Group Brexiteer members due to fear they might submit letters of no confidence challenging her leadership.",Conflict
"The Government is currently experiencing significant disorder, resulting in widespread confusion across the nation. At 3:20 pm, I departed my office, and at that time, officials at Downing Street were unable to confirm who would address my urgent question. It appears that a selection process, possibly via a WhatsApp group or similar method, designated the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) to respond to the House, despite my question being directed specifically to the Prime Minister.

Information from journalists and the Irish Government indicates that the Prime Minister may be traveling to Strasbourg this evening, or perhaps not, shortly before an important vote is scheduled to take place. On 26 February, the Prime Minister made a clear and unequivocal statement, saying:

“I want to reassure the House by making three further commitments. First, we will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest”—

with 24 hours remaining, the situation remains uncertain. She also pledged that there would be a vote on a no-deal scenario by 13 March and a vote on whether to extend article 50 by 14 March. She concluded by stating:

“They are commitments I am making as Prime Minister, and I will stick by them”—[Official Report, 26 February 2019; Vol. 655, c. 166-7.]",Conflict
"Earlier today, the Work and Pensions Committee and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee released a comprehensive report concerning the collapse of Carillion. Under usual conditions, this report would have garnered significant attention. However, due to the numerous other Government setbacks, reversals, and disputes currently unfolding, it has largely gone unnoticed. Upon the report’s release, the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves), stated:

“The company’s delusional directors drove Carillion off a cliff and then tried to blame everyone but themselves.”

It may be noted that this statement could be frequently cited in the future when referring to the Cabinet’s management of Brexit.

The Cabinet has not succeeded in fulfilling its duty to present credible measures to prevent what the Prime Minister referred to as a cliff edge. It is therefore proposed that, as would be done for an underperforming council or health authority, this Parliament should reclaim oversight and place the Cabinet under special scrutiny.",Conflict
"My right hon. Friend’s detailed knowledge is so extensive that it clarifies why Baroness Hale mistakenly believed he was the Chief Whip; he is evidently fully informed on the matter, making that an entirely understandable misunderstanding. He is, of course, entirely correct, and there is a significant issue here: those who do not support the programme motion will, in effect, be voting against Brexit taking place on 31 October. It is important that this is clearly understood, and it will not be possible to convince one group that they supported Second Reading and therefore were in favour, while telling another group that they opposed the timetable and were against Brexit; such a position will not hold.",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to the right hon. Gentleman for his understanding of parliamentary procedure and for properly moving the motion. I have been urging the Labour party to act responsibly and formally submit the motion it has repeatedly threatened.

I would like to return the right hon. Gentleman’s attention to the people’s vote, regarding which I have a genuine inquiry. He has expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the Scottish independence referendum and the 2016 referendum. Given that, why would he accept the result of a people’s vote any more readily than he has accepted those two outcomes?",Conflict
"The remarks made by the right hon. Gentleman were quite revealing. Those of us on the Conservative side do value employment highly. It is fundamentally the most crucial measure we can take to address the cost of living, so each week in this chamber, we will advocate for those who are employed and assist others in securing work. Regarding the EU and our trade relations—it is notable to hear from the Labour party that it does not wish to revisit the Brexit debate—however, it is evident that there is an increasing group within the Labour ranks whose sole objective is to reintegrate us into the single market.",Conflict
"Although it is a new year, the situation feels repetitive, with the same approach being taken: presenting Parliament with a choice between an unfavorable deal for the UK and no deal at all, while emphasizing the even more severe repercussions of no deal. In relation to the question raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), could the Secretary of State clarify the total expenditure involved in the exercise where 100 lorries were circulated around Kent? Additionally, what is his view on the impact of this exercise on the UK’s international standing? Does he believe that any other nation observes this event and considers Brexit a model worth emulating?",Conflict
"My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Supporting a different party effectively allows a Labour Government to come into power, which would neither pursue renegotiation nor hold a referendum. This outcome would likely be met with quiet satisfaction in Brussels, as no modifications would be required. For those committed to achieving reform and a referendum, there is only one option when marking their ballot.",Conflict
"Could the hon. Gentleman explain why he does not acknowledge that this Bill has arisen due to the EU's intention to disregard the agreement and what he might refer to as international law, by failing to respect the UK's sovereignty—a key element of the agreement—and by not proceeding with the free trade agreement that was intended to form the basis of the future relationship?",Conflict
"The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle) revealed her true intention when, amid her extensive rhetoric, she indicated a preference for a “much longer delay.” This reflects the position of the remain majority within this House. I was somewhat surprised to hear the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook) describe this measure as entirely uncontroversial. While he may not have been paying attention, millions of voters clearly were and had anticipated leaving the EU on 29 March. For those individuals, this debate is a significant disappointment because the order effectively cancels the exit date of 29 March. The manner in which the Council decision was reached exemplifies the reasons many chose to leave the EU, as outlined by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood).",Conflict
"There are two primary reasons why a deal has not been reached. Firstly, Members of this House have not supported a deal through their votes. Had they examined it thoroughly two years ago, they would have readily accepted all the terms set out in the withdrawal agreement and the transition period, which will now be overseen by a Brexiteer. Secondly, many within the UK have not fully recognized that it is the UK that is departing from the EU. This implies that the process is a negotiation between ourselves and the EU. There has been a lack of full comprehension of the EU and its positions, with the mistaken view that the negotiation consisted solely of demands from the UK, rather than a mutual negotiation. Additionally, the language employed—shaped by more than two decades of persistent negative messaging about the EU—contributed to the failure to secure a deal.",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to my hon. Friend for his dedicated efforts in this matter. As he is aware, we have already established a points-based immigration system to regain control over our borders. Additionally, we have completed numerous free trade agreements, and we intend to leverage the economic benefits of leaving the European Union through initiatives such as free ports. Our goal is to position this country as the most appealing destination for investment, business, and enterprise worldwide. Furthermore, we remain committed to opposing the actions of the Labour Party, which would undermine these opportunities and seek to reintegrate the UK into the European Union, as is the stated objective of the right hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer).",Conflict
"The Scottish National Party holds the position that it is neither feasible nor realistic to carry out, finalize, and implement the negotiations within the shortened deadline that has been established. Furthermore, given the context of an unprecedented global pandemic alongside a severe economic downturn, potentially the most severe in three centuries, it is considered imprudent to assume that these tasks can be accomplished appropriately within the set period.

This perspective is commonly shared among observers and commentators on the British Government’s handling of the negotiations, which includes the poorly conceived and somewhat petulant letter sent by Mr. Frost to Mr. Barnier last month. This correspondence is widely regarded as representing a low point in the British Government’s negotiation strategy.",Conflict
"My hon. Friend has frequently been invited by Members of the Opposition to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of remaining or leaving, but that is not the purpose of today’s proceedings. The Opposition have not clarified if they support holding a referendum. Today’s focus is on whether we should engage the public in this discussion—not confining it to this Chamber, but presenting it to the wider public. The Opposition aim to shift today’s debate toward the substance of the issue. I advise my hon. Friend to resist being drawn into that by Opposition Members and instead to require them to state clearly whether they will support a referendum.",Conflict
"My right hon. Friend raises a valid issue, but I would like to return to his remarks concerning the unrealistic deadlines, whereby, even if this Bill is approved, all necessary actions must be completed by the summer. Last night, I attended a Delegated Legislation Committee where we examined a technical document relating to railway safety. In that case, the Government allowed a transition period of two years. As I pointed out during the Committee, there is a two-year timeframe for the railway safety transition, yet this group appears to believe that a free trade agreement and future arrangements can be finalized within just a few months. This is quite unreasonable.",Conflict
"During my life, the outcome of general elections in Scotland has not influenced the overall UK result. The Prime Minister has consistently been selected by voters in England and Wales. Up until 2015, however, the party winning the majority of Scottish seats at Westminster, for various reasons, remained committed to eventually being part of a UK Government. Despite a significant democratic imbalance, which prompted the establishment of Scotland’s devolved Parliament, it was generally accepted that the Scottish majority would abide by the UK-wide outcome. Since 2015, however, the majority of Members representing Scottish constituencies here have taken a different stance. They hold that if the United Kingdom is unable or unwilling to meet the priorities of their constituents, then an alternative course should be available.

Although no Liberal Democrats are present, they were expressing concerns earlier regarding proportional representation. They served in government alongside this party for five years and failed to fulfill that commitment, so they have little ground to object now that the electoral system does not favor them.",Conflict
"I have submitted this urgent question primarily to obtain clarification and secondly, to request that the Minister, in all sincerity, explain to us what the Prime Minister meant when he responded “No,” something he has not yet clarified. To refer back to my earlier comments regarding mutual respect within this House, it appears that very few members here, and indeed very few people across the country, trust the Prime Minister’s statements, particularly in light of recent developments over the past few weeks. The Prime Minister himself used the word “no” in direct response to my question—[Interruption.] Given that, I have several inquiries for the Minister, and I trust that, with this renewed spirit of respect, he will provide straightforward answers.

Firstly, what course of action does the Prime Minister plan to take if a deal is not approved by this House by 19 October, nor is there an affirmative vote for no deal? That is my first question.",Conflict
"It should be evident that if the Prime Minister’s agreement is presented to the House for a fourth occasion—assuming it is permitted—it will be unsuccessful, as it has been on the three previous attempts.

To clarify, Labour does not support advancing the withdrawal agreement Bill without a deal that has been agreed upon. Doing so would be premature, and therefore Labour intends to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. How does the Secretary of State expect a Bill designed to implement a deal that is not currently before the House to be approved within two weeks? Alternatively, is this an effort to extend the Prime Minister’s tenure for another week and provide her with support ahead of today’s 1922 Committee meeting?",Conflict

"There are significant uncertainties involved in this matter, and I do not wish to add to the concerns of those on the Treasury Bench. What I will state is that there are considerable risks. I acknowledge that the Government raises an important issue here, but if that is the case, the appropriate discussion between members on the Treasury Bench and the House should focus on how we develop and amend this legislation. This should ensure that the statutory process is clearly highlighted and that the only instances in which it is bypassed—clause 9 serves as an example—are those where obtaining an extension under article 50 to allow the statutory process to be completed before departure would be unfeasible. If we proceed in this manner, the discourse in this House will become more constructive, rather than the contentious debate we have experienced in recent days.",Conflict
"I am pleased to state that Brexit has been successful. This was particularly evident during the vaccine distribution; had we followed the Opposition’s approach, the pace of vaccinations and the reopening process would have been slower. We have restored our autonomy, allowing us to make independent decisions. However, the SNP’s position is unusual, as they seek independence only to transfer authority to the European Union and be directed by Brussels. If SNP Members choose to promote this stance, I doubt it will gain traction. The issue mentioned by the hon. Gentleman is currently under consideration between the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and I am confident it will be established at an appropriate time.",Conflict
"Madam Deputy Speaker, I must alert you and everyone present that I am about to mention the C-word. There are 203 days until Christmas, an occasion that most will of course look forward to, but there are also 140 days remaining until the scheduled date for leaving the European Union without a deal—an outcome that businesses certainly oppose and for which there is no majority support either in this House or across the country. Regrettably, Labour Front Benchers did not secure enough votes from their own MPs yesterday to initiate the process to prevent a no-deal exit. The Leader of the House, who is a respectable individual and consistently strives to do his best, has stated that the Government believes Parliament should not be prorogued by whoever becomes the next Prime Minister in a manner that excludes Parliament and leads to a no-deal departure. Therefore, the Government apparently considers such an action inappropriate for any future Prime Minister. What steps will he take to guarantee that Parliament gains control of the procedure and that we do not leave without a deal at the end of October due to the actions of an irresponsible Prime Minister?",Conflict
"Should this agreement be rejected, it would be prudent not to persist with an issue that has been exhausted. Appreciation is due to Monsieur Juncker and Monsieur Barnier for the various reassurance letters they have issued, though it is acknowledged that these hold no legal standing. Rather than accepting another superficial gesture from Brussels, it is hoped that the Government will return with a strategy aligned with the Prime Minister’s initial approach, as set out at Lancaster House. This would involve retaining the reasonable elements of the withdrawal agreement, removing the backstop, agreeing to an implementation period during which a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement can be negotiated, withholding at least half of the £39 billion until such an agreement is finalised, affirming the widely understood position that there is no plan, intention, or necessity for a hard border in Northern Ireland, and proceeding promptly and energetically with preparations for a no-deal scenario.

It is recognised that there may be bureaucratic, technical, or logistical challenges; however, as Monsieur Puissesseau of the Calais-Boulogne ports has indicated, these can be addressed through a determined and optimistic approach. Such a mindset is deemed appropriate for the ongoing Brexit process.",Conflict
"Concerns about the effectiveness or productivity of individuals working from home are not limited to SNP Members. However, if there is a genuine belief that conducting negotiations remotely is unworkable, it raises the question of why there was such strong insistence on the ability to operate effectively as MPs through the virtual Parliament system, which the SNP were keen to preserve. For example, on 8 June in this chamber, the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Patrick Grady) presented a compelling argument in favor of maintaining remote and hybrid working arrangements, stating that they were functioning well and should be fully reinstated. While I do not think he advocates for a double standard between MPs and others, I do concur that remote working can be effective, as demonstrated daily by our negotiating teams in their ongoing crucial efforts related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.",Conflict
"Certainly not. Only someone lacking any comprehension or acting in bad faith would pose the question about the origins of violence as if mere optimism justifies disregarding a solemn peace agreement. Only an individual who either fails to understand or deliberately misleads would raise such a misleading question repeatedly. It is acknowledged that, regrettably, individuals across various political backgrounds have at times sought to exploit violence as a pretext. This is why my party, along with others, undertook the substantial efforts required to secure peace, while your party remained on the sidelines, holding placards and opposing the Good Friday Agreement at every opportunity. Therefore, I will not accept insincere questions or unsolicited admonishments, thank you.",Conflict
"What has been particularly disheartening is the fact that some Members on the Labour Front Bench have collaborated with the Government. The Government had no intention of allowing a debate on these significant issues, for reasons I sincerely understand and respect. However, for the Labour party to act contrary to its traditional principles is quite regrettable. This situation reflects a mixture of inefficiency within its Front Bench and significant internal divisions, with a few notable exceptions—among whom I count the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn). These Members have abandoned their historic support for the free movement of people and have not effectively advocated for the benefits of immigration.

The referendum result revealed a deeply divided country, a division that is perhaps most evident within the Labour party. Labour Members have appeared bewildered—effectively immobilised—concerned that their local party organisations have been dominated by the far left, and in many cases, recognising that as many as 70% of their own electorate voted to leave.",Conflict
"Could the Minister confirm that in his talks with international partners he will firmly advocate that the protocol must not persist? Will he clarify that it has damaged the Belfast agreement, weakened democratic processes in Northern Ireland, raised expenses for both consumers and businesses, disrupted trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland while substituting it with trade involving the Republic, and that the EU is deliberately employing it as a tool to penalise the UK for its departure from the EU, irrespective of the impact on the people of Northern Ireland?",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to the Leader of the House for outlining the schedule for the upcoming week, and I fully endorse her remarks regarding Holocaust Memorial Day.

Tomorrow is Burns Night, Mr Speaker, and we are aware of your fondness for haggis. We cannot overlook the memorable Selkirk Grace you delivered at an SNP Burns supper a few years ago. Burns captured the essence of Brexit in these lines:

“The best-laid plans of mice and men

Often go awry,

And leave us nothing but grief and pain,

Instead of promised joy!”

For colleagues unfamiliar with 18th-century Scots, “aft a-gley” translates to “gone wrong,” and Burns’ words aptly characterize this self-defeating, isolating, and regrettable situation.

On Tuesday, we will have Brexit amendment day. The responsibility for selecting the amendments will rest solely with you, Mr Speaker.

"The Government have created a difficult situation for themselves, as clearly explained by the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Sir Bernard Jenkin). Over a period of three years, the Government encountered significant challenges in securing approval for their withdrawal agreement in this House. They devoted so much time to it that it is unlikely any detail of the agreement was unfamiliar to them. In January, they entered into a legally binding international treaty. The Prime Minister endorsed the agreement and referred to it as a “negotiating triumph” at that time. Beyond being a negotiating success, he informed the public in December that the deal was “oven-ready” and ready for implementation. He campaigned on the promise, “Vote for me and I will get Brexit done,” and the electorate in England supported him for reasons that remain unclear to me. Subsequently, in December, with a substantial majority, he led all Conservative MPs to vote in favour of the agreement. However, the Government now intend to unilaterally alter the terms and withdraw from commitments made earlier this year. In doing so, they are willing to breach international law, further damage the United Kingdom’s already reduced standing, and undermine the devolution framework. This represents a notable development even by the standards of this Government.",Conflict

Gentleman clarify why he does not recognize that this Bill has been introduced in response to the EU’s plan to contravene the agreement, which he might describe as international law, by disregarding the UK’s sovereignty—an integral part of the agreement—and by not moving forward with the free trade agreement that was meant to serve as the foundation of the future relationship?",Conflict
"There comes a time when we must acknowledge the necessity of completing these negotiations, recognizing that presenting a united stance to Europe is the most effective approach.

We have been assured that no ongoing commentary will be provided. In her consistently forceful speech, my hon.

Amendment (a) to new clause 5 would explicitly permit new clause 5 to facilitate the implementation of the Lugano convention. Comparable amendments have been submitted by the Chair of the Justice Committee and the Scottish National Party. Each of these proposals would enable the Government to pursue their declared objective of implementing the Lugano convention without conferring extensive Henry VIII powers or the capacity to bypass Parliament. To the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon.

"Allow me to address the core issue directly, as I have already spoken longer than intended. As I have mentioned, any proposal suggesting that Parliament should relinquish complete authority to any Government in managing such matters would have been met with strong opposition, rather than the typical applause and dissent directed at any Minister who attempted this. It has been suggested—the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) finds this convincing, though I do not share his view—that the next point raised will be, “You are effectively saying that the House of Commons should assume control of the negotiations.” Naturally, this is not the case. I fully concur that such a notion is unreasonable.",Conflict
"This leads us to the concept that “no deal is preferable to a bad deal.” The Prime Minister has demonstrated an inability to secure an agreement even with her close partners in the DUP—and initially, she was unaware of this. On 10 June, there was a statement declaring, “We have reached a deal with the DUP.” Subsequently, it was clarified that “there is no deal with the DUP.” The Queen’s Speech was delayed by two days to allow time for the agreement to be finalized, yet, at present, no agreement has been reached with the DUP. Given these circumstances, how can confidence be placed in the Prime Minister’s capacity to lead a minority Government and negotiate a more favorable agreement with the other 27 EU member states? This situation appears inconsistent.",Conflict

I am optimistic that this amendment will pass tonight; however, if it does not, it will be due to the Prime Minister’s commitment at the Dispatch Box to return to the House on 14 February with a motion similar to this one, which will also be open to amendments. My hon. Friends and I, alongside colleagues from across the House, will then propose a comparable amendment accompanied by a similar Bill, and I trust that Members will back these efforts.",Conflict

Although it is not possible to achieve this through primary legislation—if it were, we would do so—we commit that if Labour is in government, the statutory instrument concerning this issue will be debated on the Floor of both Houses rather than in a Committee. This approach guarantees that all Members have the chance to speak if called upon and the right to vote on the matter.” ––[Official Report, Higher Education Public Bill Committee, 26 February 2004; c. 323.]

"Prior to the consideration of the withdrawal agreement Bill, could we arrange a discussion regarding masochism, Mr Speaker? It appears to me that the hallmark of May-ite Conservatism is repeating the same actions repeatedly while anticipating a different outcome. This perplexing state seems to entail misunderstanding, inattention, and self-punishment—which they appear to have embraced—ultimately resulting in division, stagnation, and political demise. The notion that the Prime Minister will succeed this time seems to disregard reason, especially as Members continue to express their unwillingness to back her withdrawal agreement Bill. Her sole remaining strategy may be to secure Labour party members' abstention, but I believe the shadow Secretary of State for Brexit indicated today that Labour will not abstain, which I hope is accurate.

Another week has passed, and the individuals in grey attire remain stationed outside No. 10, attempting to persuade the current occupant to depart.

They request that you consider providing this House, at the earliest possible moment, with the opportunity to debate and determine whether this issue constitutes a contempt. It appears to me that the Government have made an unprecedented choice to disregard the unanimous and binding decision of this House. Rather, they seem to be attempting to delay proceedings in the hope that contempt procedures will extend beyond the timeframe for the meaningful vote. However, this House cannot permit that to occur. I therefore ask you to clarify the appropriate steps we should take to address and resolve this important matter.",Conflict
"May I further question the Prime Minister regarding the idea that she might reject any results from indicative votes on the grounds that they may not be subject to negotiation with the EU? As the Chancellor informed her yesterday, a confirmatory referendum—a people’s vote—is a fully feasible option. I seek clarification, and I do not intend to disrupt her while she is using her phone, but if she could kindly respond—[Interruption.] She was on the phone, Mr Speaker. I would like a direct answer: if this House were to approve a confirmatory referendum, would she commit to respecting that outcome? Yes or no?",Conflict
"I thank the right hon. Gentleman for allowing me to intervene. Could he explain why he dismisses the votes of 1 million Scots who opted to leave? Why does he disregard the positions of the National Farmers Union of Scotland, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce, the Scotch Whisky Association, Diageo, and several other business and trade organizations that are urging all Scottish Members of Parliament to back the Prime Minister’s agreement in order to ensure an orderly Brexit?",Conflict
"It is essential that the Government and its relevant bodies provide full assistance and cooperation to the Culture Committee, the Electoral Commission, and the Mueller investigations. Although I understand this may not fall within the Minister’s direct remit, I would appreciate a confirmation to the House that such support will be forthcoming, particularly as I have been informed that the Mueller team recently visited London and expressed dissatisfaction with the level of cooperation from UK authorities. It is the Intelligence and Security Committee that enjoys more unrestricted and direct access to our intelligence and security agencies and is able to question them without intermediaries. This underscores the importance of its re-establishment.

In spite of increasing evidence over recent months, the Foreign Secretary maintained last week that he had not seen proof of Russian interference. However, in her Mansion House speech on Monday, the Prime Minister conveyed, or at least suggested, a markedly different position. She strongly condemned the Putin administration for engaging in hacking, meddling in elections, and disseminating false information aimed at creating division within Western democracies and undermining the international order.",Conflict
"The hon. and learned Gentleman states that his party honors the outcome of the referendum and does not intend to challenge the decision made by the British public. However, the tactics adopted by some Opposition Members appear to contradict that claim. The shadow Foreign Secretary, the hon. Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry), has indicated that the referendum result—the largest democratic endorsement for a course of action secured by any Government—requires an “injection of democracy.” Additionally, the hon. Member for Pontypridd (Owen Smith) has proposed that Labour would seek to amend any article 50 Bill to facilitate a second referendum.",Conflict
"I must now address the Labour party. The Scottish National party was the first to submit a motion of no confidence, which was supported by others including the Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru, and the Green party, and we requested that it be debated before Christmas. Yesterday, it became clear that the Government was actively considering permitting a debate and vote on that motion today. The Labour party has now been compelled to submit the motion to the House—a motion that ideally should have been discussed prior to Christmas. I welcome the debate taking place today, but based on what transpires, I make this request to our colleagues and friends in the Labour party: we need to collaborate in holding this Government accountable, and to do so, we must acknowledge the negative impact Brexit will have on all our constituents. It is time for the Leader of the Opposition to acknowledge that there is no such thing as a “jobs first” Brexit.",Conflict
"As do many reasonable politicians, I rely on independent specialists to provide insights and responses to intricate issues like those involving the natural environment. Since other Members have already articulated my views on the circular economy effectively, I will proceed to my subsequent point.

The Institution of Environmental Sciences is presently undertaking a survey among its members, posing the question:

“What effect do you anticipate the UK’s exit from the EU will have on environmental protection?”

A significant majority—81%—of well-qualified and experienced environmental experts believe that

“in the absence of binding EU legislation, environmental regulations in the UK are likely to be weakened or abolished.”",Conflict
"Following yesterday’s events, I do not consider it appropriate to receive lessons on dignity from the right hon. Gentleman. Nonetheless, we have gained some insight into the disruptive methods anticipated in this Parliament, including chanting aligned with his statements. I acknowledge his opposition to Brexit, which he is fully entitled to hold. However, he does not have the right to disregard the perspectives of over one million individuals in Scotland who supported Brexit, views which the SNP appears to overlook. Similarly, he cannot dismiss the outcome of the referendum across the entire United Kingdom. Consequently, it is the responsibility of this Government to implement Brexit, and that is the commitment we intend to fulfill.

I trust that the right hon. Gentleman was not deliberately misconstruing the Sewel convention, as it is not an absolute principle. He presented it as such, but that is not the case. As I indicated in my statement, the Government will seek consent except where exceptional circumstances exist, and it is widely acknowledged that the UK’s departure from the EU constitutes such exceptional circumstances.",Conflict
"Does my hon. Friend also feel disheartened by the approach taken by the Opposition parties, especially the Scottish National Party, who appear to prioritize creating conflict and division within our United Kingdom instead of focusing on the national interest? Were their true aim to support the economy and the citizens of our nation, they would back the Government in its efforts to secure an orderly withdrawal agreement from the EU by 31 October.",Conflict
"Could we have a debate titled “Project Fear” to allow the Leader of the House, and especially the former Chancellor, to consider the prudence of framing the arguments against leaving the European Union as an immediate catastrophic crisis requiring emergency budgeting, rather than focusing on the longer-term harm that withdrawal from the European single market will inevitably cause to the country? Since the Leader of the House was deeply involved in “Project Fear,” can he provide the House with a guarantee that Treasury statistics and projections will not be so evidently misused in any future referendum campaigns?",Conflict
"Nevertheless, the situation is as it stands. It is evident that the Brexit process must be managed in a manner that does not negatively affect the Good Friday agreement. I have listened attentively to Members of the DUP and appreciate that any proposal suggesting that leaving the EU would result in Northern Ireland being separated into a distinct regulatory framework, either to uphold the Good Friday agreement or to maintain regulatory alignment with the Republic of Ireland, is completely unacceptable. Such a notion is entirely off the table for me, and I did not interpret the Prime Minister’s statements or the agreement she reached as indicating any intention to pursue such a course. Were that the case, I can only say that she would not maintain the support of her party, which is united in its stance on this issue, regardless of individual Members’ positions on Brexit itself. Consequently, this matter must be set aside.",Conflict
"On 14 January, the Prime Minister confirmed to the House that the entitlement to be British, Irish, or both in Northern Ireland is explicitly outlined in the withdrawal agreement. However, during a statement in Belfast on 5 February, the Prime Minister acknowledged that

“I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered difficulties in securing their”—

Irish—

“rights as Irish citizens”.

In light of this, does the Prime Minister acknowledge and concur that Emma DeSouza and numerous others in Northern Ireland hold Irish citizenship and are consequently EU citizens, despite the Home Office’s position that they are British?",Conflict
"Mr Speaker, as you will remember, there have been numerous debates and statements in this House—this is indisputable—but Parliament has not been fully engaged in efforts to negotiate a compromise or to find a method of implementing Brexit. Such engagement ought to have occurred at the outset of the process, yet, ironically, it is only happening now. Regrettably, my right hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey) are not present at the moment, but their comments on compromise at this late juncture—perhaps indicating a lack of awareness or understanding of all that has transpired over the past two and a half years—were, at best, unfortunate.

It is with no satisfaction that I state this, but the responsibility rests clearly and directly with the leadership—or the absence thereof—at the highest tiers of Government, in the Cabinet, and within my party. On numerous occasions, Members of this House who supported remain have engaged in extensive discussions with the Prime Minister, offering advice on how to honour the referendum result, maintain unity in this House, foster consensus, and address those who were determined to pursue a hard Brexit regardless of compromise.",Conflict
"Not intentionally—but on several occasions by chance. [Laughter.] The hon. Gentleman refers to my considerable length of service, which stands as the one uncontested aspect of my time in this Chamber. Nearly all my former colleagues from various Governments have since been elevated to the House of Lords, where they continue to discuss these very issues. In fact, all those who served alongside me in Governments during my tenure—especially under Margaret Thatcher and John Major—who remain with us and sit in the House of Lords are supporting this motion. They share the same view, as reaching a situation of this nature is entirely without precedent.",Conflict
"I will now address the issue of whether we have established a practical agreement with Turkey. Turkey and the European Union have entered into an agreement whereby Turkey receives expedited visa access in exchange for £3 billion in aid, with the possibility of further financial assistance. Additionally, there is the potential for renewed EU membership discussions contingent upon Turkey's commitment to a migration action plan. I hold a strong scepticism regarding this arrangement. It appears to involve providing funds that resemble a form of inducement to Turkey. Based on information I have gathered, including from a recent meeting I attended, Turkish authorities have not been consistently rigorous in implementing the agreed measures. The movement of a large number of individuals through Europe toward Germany, which has caused significant disruption, is largely attributable to what I perceive as Turkey's recent lack of effective enforcement.",Conflict

"The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published a report last week, which received unanimous support from its members, addressing the topic of disinformation, especially concerning election campaigns. In light of this report and the concerns related to the leave campaigns, some of which involve allegations of large-scale fraud, why has the Prime Minister not established a judge-led public inquiry with the authority to call for evidence and witnesses, to assess whether the decision is being made based on a campaign and outcome that may be fraudulent?",Conflict
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. It is a genuine privilege to address this, my initial debate of the new decade, with you presiding and on a matter of significant importance—Britain’s role on the global stage. In an era where international affairs present numerous concerns and as we proceed with our departure from the European Union, I was quite disheartened that the Queen’s Speech failed to acknowledge the opportunities and challenges facing my constituency, my region, and the nation as a whole, especially considering that the agreement governing our exit from the EU is among the least favourable.",Conflict
"I acknowledge the right hon. Member for Putney (Justine Greening) for raising the urgent question, and I express my gratitude to you, Mr Speaker, for allowing it.

In the previous week, the House voted by a large majority to exclude any option of departing the EU without a deal. Should the Government, through delay or other reasons, lead us to leave without an agreement, it would represent a significant instance of disregard for Parliament, unprecedented not only in this House but in any parliamentary history. The Government now have 11 days remaining to undertake the necessary measures to prevent this outcome. When the no-deal option was dismissed last Tuesday, 17 days remained, indicating that the Government have used over one-third of that period without taking action. While the Minister made numerous assurances about intended steps, they were unable to provide information on what has actually been done to obtain and confirm that extension.",Conflict
"It is essential to recall the steps that led to our current situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) pointed out that, before the Lisbon treaty, these issues were not within the European Court of Justice’s authority. They were previously handled as intergovernmental matters. Notably, it was the former Labour Government that made the decision resulting in our present circumstances. They placed us in this legal position, which should have been avoided. It is important that we, as members of the Conservative party, acknowledge the role of the previous Labour Government. They agreed to a treaty that was intended to be subjected to a referendum, which ultimately did not occur, and this House was asked to approve a package that, in my view, the British public was not given the chance to accept or reject.",Conflict
"I do not think it is mere chance that both the Foreign Secretary and his predecessor—who could reasonably be described as having been Eurosceptics—are now advocating for the UK to remain in the European Union after having firsthand experience of how membership provides global influence. We should therefore acknowledge that this Government has not one but two departments responsible for education within Whitehall. The first is the Department for Education, and the second is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has not permitted a greater number of Conservative Eurosceptics to serve in the FCO and participate in its effective retraining and conversion programme.",Conflict
"At some stage during this debate, perhaps on a different day, I intend to address comprehensively all the points raised by the right hon. Gentleman—including the various anecdotal evidence he has mentioned and the accounts he has shared. Essentially, his argument concerning Brexit, nationalism, and Northern Ireland’s future appears to suggest that Brexit should be disregarded entirely. That seems to be the implication of his position. What I would like him to clarify is this: what new commitments or changes has the Prime Minister introduced? That is the information we are awaiting.",Conflict
"Regarding standards, the Bill weakens the position of farmers. It diminishes our animal welfare standards. It compromises the devolution settlement and does not provide adequate oversight, similar to the Trade Bill previously and still does. Consequently, Ministers will have the freedom to act as they please. This reflects a serious lack of competence and responsibility, and a reconsideration is necessary.",Conflict
"Parliament has been effective in halting Brexit proposals but has struggled to offer Brexit solutions. There are numerous reasons to argue for a delay, and I could readily list concerns I have with the terms of the current deal, which is somewhat less focused on Europe than the earlier agreement put forward. However, the previous deal never gained the necessary support to pass through the House, whereas this deal currently does. Let us be pragmatic: the likelihood of reopening the deal is very low. If anyone plans to vote against the Second Reading, they should be transparent and acknowledge that their opposition is because they prefer a second referendum or wish to revoke the triggering of Article 50.",Conflict
"Rather than fostering constructive dialogue, harmful language and divisive rhetoric have taken root, affecting not only our political environment but society as a whole. Similarly, just as the Government has failed to engage with the broader country, it has also not reached out to other Members of this House. At the beginning of his speech, which now seems distant, the Attorney General stated that this situation was arrived at reluctantly. That assertion is incorrect. Every decision made along the way—decisions made deliberately and knowingly by the Prime Minister—has brought us, not reluctantly, but inevitably to the current position.

It is unacceptable that an entire month has been lost due to a deliberate attempt to run down the clock because the Prime Minister feared losing the vote, which, in any case, she is set to lose this evening. I am unable to support the withdrawal agreement or the political declaration for several reasons already outlined by Members, including the fact that they fail to address 80% of our economy—the services sector upon which thousands of jobs rely.",Conflict
"My hon. Friend raises a very important point. In recent times, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been engaged in discussions with the devolved Administrations to secure a functioning internal market within the United Kingdom as we exit the European Union. An agreement has been reached with the Welsh Government. Mark Drakeford, the Labour Minister, has demonstrated a willingness to be flexible and has adopted a cooperative stance, which contrasts sharply with the position of the Scottish Government and the First Minister of Scotland, who have prioritized a narrow ideological goal of separation over the interests of the Scottish people—this is not the first occasion on which this has occurred.",Conflict
It is evident that the hon. Gentleman did not hear my response to the earlier question. Implementing Brexit will require this House to consider no fewer than 10 primary legislative measures. This does not amount to excluding Parliament from having input on the matter.,Conflict

"During my previous address to the House on 25 September—the right hon. Gentleman referred to the statement I made at that time—I extended an invitation to any Member of Parliament to visit the Cabinet Office and the Department for Exiting the European Union to engage in discussions regarding a deal and preparations for a no-deal scenario. Only two Opposition MPs accepted this offer: the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) and the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). This response reflects the level of engagement from the Labour party, the SNP, and other Opposition parties concerning the Brexit negotiations: an open invitation to participate declined outright.

Is this unexpected? In 2017, the right hon. Gentleman stated about the referendum:

“We’ve had a decision and we respect that decision.”

He also remarked that the Labour party cannot dedicate all its efforts to attempting to “rub out yesterday” and must honour the outcome it is obliged to accept. As I noted earlier, after having voted against the deal on three occasions, he declined the chance to collaborate across party lines to secure an agreement.",Conflict
"This situation is entirely unacceptable. If amendment 14 to the Finance (No. 3) Bill had been put to a vote last week, it would have succeeded and would have obligated the Government to present a model using remain as the baseline for comparison against their proposed withdrawal agreement. Based on commitments made at the Dispatch Box, we chose not to push it to a vote. The Minister has denied that these assurances were provided, but I feel compelled to read the statement made by the Exchequer Secretary to both myself and the right hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry): “I will explain at the Dispatch Box that we will examine three scenarios: WTO, FTA, and the Government’s proposed deal.” There is no uncertainty regarding the promise given to us, which led to our decision not to pursue amendment 14. Can the Financial Secretary clarify why I should not conclude that the right hon. Member for Broxtowe and I have been misled, and does this analysis not demonstrate the central point that the best option available is the current arrangement, hence the necessity for a people’s vote to resolve this matter?",Conflict
"Several of us directly urged the Prime Minister to bypass the Labour Front Bench, which has performed inadequately in its role as Her Majesty’s Opposition, and to build a consensus that clearly existed not only among Labour Back Benchers but also with the SNP, whose Members have consistently expressed willingness to support remaining in the single market and customs union. We made efforts to establish this early on, but were disregarded, similar to the 48%, while the Prime Minister chose to prioritize appeasing the ERG members, who have effectively become a faction within the party.

I will refrain from repeating the insightful remarks made by my colleague, the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden), but the situation was further complicated by the introduction of slogans such as “Brexit means Brexit,” which lacked clear definition. Most concerning was the assertion that no deal would be preferable to a bad deal, leaving us now in the position of arguing that no deal would in fact be the worst possible result. Only after all other options had been explored was the idea of a people’s vote adopted, which is currently viewed as the sole viable solution to resolve the situation.",Conflict
"I appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s observations. Reflecting on the last three years, it is possible to identify actions that might have been approached differently or altered.

Engaging in speculation about “if,” “what,” or “could” is an interesting exercise—hindsight is always clearer—but it is important to remember that the other 27 member states each maintained their own firm positions. The notion that, had either I or the hon. Gentleman assumed the role of UK Prime Minister, all other member states would have immediately welcomed us with offers of favourable agreements is unrealistic. The other member states’ established boundaries would have remained unchanged.",Conflict

Are Conservative Members suggesting that the Prime Minister was not being entirely honest?",Conflict
"I praise my right hon. Friend both for his suggestions and for his ability to bring together members across all parties who favor leaving the European Union with an agreement. The conversations we have today will be observed attentively by our European Union counterparts, whose trust in our ability to finalize a deal will rely on their perception of whether the House is likely to endorse the ultimate agreement. I propose to my right hon. Friend that a vote take place in the House to evaluate his negotiation strategy and to demonstrate to our European Union colleagues that we stand united in backing it.",Conflict
"I am very thankful to my hon. Friend for that contribution, as I not only remember it clearly but had initially included it in my own remarks before removing it due to time constraints.

Regarding the United States, I am confident that the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, who, like myself, possesses experience in complex international negotiations, understands that one of the primary requirements is to pay close attention to the actual statements made. It was not the President of the United States who declared that Britain would be at the front of the queue; rather, such claims originated from British politicians. The President’s comment was simply, “You’re doing great.” I do not find much reassurance in that, particularly given that it comes from a President whose guiding principle is “America first.” I fully acknowledge the concerns that have been raised, and which are likely to be reiterated during this discussion, regarding the potential for American companies to seek to take advantage of our healthcare sector or to push for the relaxation of regulations, for instance in areas like food safety.",Conflict
"Certainly. As has been noted, there was more opportunity to debate the Scotland Bill. It is likely that this will not be the final piece of legislation concerning Scotland; I observe that the Secretary of State for Scotland is now present. He will probably need to guide through another Scotland Bill within this Parliament due to Brexit, in order to transfer all the powers he committed to delivering.

This marks only the start. The Government intends to introduce the Great Repeal Bill, which is increasingly referred to as “the great power grab.” They must be prepared to submit to the House’s scrutiny. We have been elected to carry out a responsibility, and that is what we have fulfilled this evening with our amendments. We will persist in this approach throughout the consideration of this Bill and all subsequent legislation associated with Brexit. [Interruption.]",Conflict
"The Government may assert that it is safeguarding employment rights established under EU law; however, it could choose to gradually diminish those rights in the manner I have described. I anticipate that many Government Members will find this difficult to resist—not in terms of eliminating rights entirely, but by considerably reducing their strength. My reasoning is based on statements previously made by members of the Cabinet, which provide insight into their perspectives. Although these remarks have been referenced frequently this evening, their significance warrants reiteration. To begin with the highest level, the Prime Minister, during an interview with HR magazine in March 2010 while serving as shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, expressed particular concern regarding the Working Time Directive and the Agency Workers Directive. Additionally, in 2012, the Foreign Secretary advocated for the abolition of the social chapter, and more recently suggested that the Government should actively intervene in matters related to the social chapter, describing the extent of employment regulation as excessively burdensome. Furthermore, when the Secretary of State for Defence held the position of Minister for Business and Enterprise, he emphasized the need for the Government to intensify efforts to reduce what he termed burdensome regulatory requirements.",Conflict
"The Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Alliance Party, the Green Party, and Sinn Féin may collectively oppose the DUP on this matter, but should direct rule be reinstated and no Northern Ireland Government established, we will not permit any special status to be imposed contrary to the interests and preferences of the Unionist community. This issue requires agreement across communities—no other approach will succeed without devolution. If Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Green Party, and the Alliance Party seek special status for Northern Ireland, it can only be achieved through a devolved Government that enables consensus-building on the matter. Without a devolved Government, Sinn Féin’s efforts will not prevail; symbolic protests or border demonstrations will not influence Brussels. The sole means to advance Northern Ireland’s interests is either through having its own Government or through representation by my colleagues and me in this Chamber. I anticipate that a robust DUP delegation will be elected in the forthcoming general election to represent Northern Ireland here.",Conflict
"I tell my hon. Friend that the proposal for a comprehensive customs union has been put forward repeatedly over many months. It has not been given proper consideration due to the Prime Minister’s stance; this is not the fault of the Opposition. To be clear: we will not risk the futures of everyone based on the results of a Conservative party leadership election, over which most Members have no influence and can only observe.

In the absence of the necessary clarity and safeguards within the political declaration, we should not endorse this withdrawal agreement. The vote today is a poor tactic from a Government attempting to avoid facing the fact that a substantive vote on both the political declaration and the withdrawal agreement must be returned to the House. For many months, the Prime Minister’s deal has caused division and disagreement when unity was required for progress. The national interest lies in achieving agreement on a future that safeguards the employment and well-being of all our constituents. Therefore, the House ought to dismiss this motion.",Conflict
"Regarding Europol, what is the Government’s outlook for the future? Are they aiming for full membership, or simply observer status at board meetings? At present, this remains unclear. The current critical situation and unsatisfactory position are attributable to the Government rather than those working within the security sector. The UK makes a significant contribution to European security. For example, through the Schengen Information System, known as SIS II, the UK participates in the exchange of real-time information on wanted criminals, missing individuals, and suspected terrorists, a collaboration that benefits everyone involved. The data in that system are accessed millions of times annually by UK police forces, which should demonstrate to all Members the considerable risk posed by the absence of a long-term security agreement.",Conflict

I observe the differing perspectives between the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Angus Brendan MacNeil). Our intention is to continue refining our policy. I have consistently stated that the single market issue presents greater complexity due to free movement, but where agreement can be reached with certain Conservative Members, we should seek to strengthen that shared purpose. Ultimately, if the Government find themselves unable to pass their policies through the House of Commons, they will need to reconsider their position. As I mentioned in my previous address to the House, should the Government fail to fulfill their responsibilities, the House will be required to take action in their stead.",Conflict
"As is often the case, the hon. Lady has raised a very pertinent point. Her contributions stand out as some of the more measured ones heard during this debate, reflecting her commitment to representing her constituents and others across the United Kingdom.

I observed recently, regarding the current no-deal scenario, that one Conservative Member of Parliament—indeed, the longest-serving Conservative MP in the House—referred to a faction within the Conservative party as the “headbanger” wing. I am unsure of the designations of other factions, but that description caught my attention: the party evidently includes a significant group identified by that term. While discussing no deal, I also recall a remark attributed to the Dutch Prime Minister, who reportedly likened a decision to proceed with no deal to

“the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way”.

The Chancellor appears to understand this issue, as reflected in his spring statement today, where he emphasized the importance of a smooth and orderly transition, which he indicated would be jeopardized by a no-deal outcome. He acknowledged the potential risks to employment and wages, yet the matter remains under discussion and no definitive exclusion of no deal has been made.",Conflict

"May I extend my best wishes for a happy new year to you, Mr Speaker, as well as to all Members and parliamentary staff?

It is unfortunate that we resume proceedings after the Christmas recess without any advancement from the Government regarding the withdrawal agreement and, notably, with the Prime Minister absent from the House. She has not attended. With only a few days remaining before the deadline to secure an agreement that safeguards our economy, the Prime Minister is not present to account for the lack of progress. Can the Prime Minister explain why she is not addressing this urgent matter?

It has become evident that the Prime Minister’s approach is to use up time, thereby limiting Parliament’s options to alternatives to her Brexit plan, increasing the likelihood of a no-deal outcome. The SNP intends to collaborate across the House to garner support for an alternative approach involving a further EU referendum, allowing the public to reclaim control from the current Government. I also urge the Leader of the Opposition to take a clear stance and join us in opposing this Government’s disordered Brexit strategy.",Conflict
"It is therefore unfortunate that the official Opposition did not have a single Back Bench Member present to speak in support of devolution today. While they have only one hon.

Their absence today is not unexpected, considering that their counterparts in the House of Lords refrained from acting yesterday on amendments aimed at maintaining state aid as a devolved issue, as well as Lord Thomas’s amendment opposing the Government’s provisions on direct spending in devolved areas. This situation stands in contrast to the commitment made by the former leader of the Labour party. However, Labour has not taken action. The party is prepared to bring forward Gordon Brown to discuss federalism when independence is a prominent topic, but it is absent when it comes to upholding the current devolved arrangements. This situation is regrettable, and it is left to the SNP to advocate for devolution. Although the prospects are bleak, this will only serve to strengthen the argument for independence.",Conflict
"The Prime Minister attended the European Council to obtain legal guarantees but did not receive any, with the subsequent Council meeting planned for the third week of March. Given that Cabinet Ministers are now publicly discussing potential outcomes if her deal is rejected, can she clarify to the House what is achieved by maintaining the pretense that leaving the European Union without a deal remains a possibility, especially when she is well aware of the serious harm such an outcome would cause and has just informed the House that it would endanger the “jobs, services and security” of the public?",Conflict
"Why does the hon. Gentleman not recognize that this Bill has been prompted by the EU's plan to contravene the agreement and what he may refer to as international law, by overlooking the UK's sovereignty—a key element of the agreement—and by choosing not to move forward with the free trade agreement that was meant to underpin the future relationship?",Conflict
"Once again, the Government has announced a controversial payment that appears intended to divert attention from their unsuccessful Brexit strategy.

To begin, I would like to ask the Secretary of State whether the funding will be subject to the Barnett formula for Scotland, and when Scotland can expect to receive its portion. Mr Speaker, I seek clarification on the Barnettisation of these funds because every city deal to date has resulted in Scotland receiving less than it should, with the Scottish Government repeatedly contributing more funds than the UK Government.

While I do not oppose investment in any town, this announcement represents a minor token amid the broader context of austerity measures. The £1.6 billion allocated today is minimal compared to the EU funding that would have been available. According to the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, the UK would have been entitled to €13 billion over the same timeframe. The £33 million designated for the south-west region alone is equivalent to just one Grayling.",Conflict

The concern is that the referendum may fail to resolve the issue definitively in the manner that Members expect.",Conflict
"The address of the day, in my view, was delivered by my respected colleague, the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)—not merely due to its duration, but also its substance. He presented several thoughtful arguments and was notably candid about what the British public might anticipate from the leave campaign regarding the implications of departure. He openly acknowledged uncertainties surrounding the future of the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy. Since many currently endorse these policies, it is crucial for them to grasp the potential outcomes of leaving. His willingness to raise these issues was commendable, and the country needs to engage with these questions through a thorough debate.

The phrase “Project Fear” has frequently appeared in this discourse. Our aim is to prevail in the discussion because individuals have weighed the merits—the reasons and explanations—on both sides, rather than due to ambiguity about positions or tactics involving fearmongering. A concern is that the debate could deteriorate into something akin to an American presidential election campaign, where negativity dominates over positive aspects and informed perspectives.

We are not confronted with insightful, capable individuals presenting new options for the country; instead, it is merely ongoing criticism. They represent a fatigued and unmotivated Opposition. Initially, I considered describing them as beige, but it seems more fitting to compare them to a Farrow and Ball palette. Upon reviewing their colours, the nearest to beige I found was named smoked trout, which appears quite appropriate.",Conflict
"Observers will have seen that the Minister has spoken at the Dispatch Box for close to 40 minutes and has yet to provide a direct response to a straightforward question, which I will ask once more. Without the backing of this House for either a deal or no deal, how does the Government intend to adhere to the Benn Act and ensure the United Kingdom exits the European Union by 31 October?",Conflict
"With a Prime Minister who has a background in public relations, this Government tends to issue press statements quickly but struggles to follow through on their promises, which necessitates a debate during Government time focused on Government inefficiency. Now in their fourth year of administration, only one of the 261 new schools pledged in their “priority” building programme has been completed; just seven of the 576 infrastructure projects promised have been finished; and only 2,000 of the 100,000 new homes committed under the NewBuy scheme have been delivered. They announced plans to establish a British investment bank to support business growth, yet no businesses have received assistance. The Youth Contract was introduced to help young people return to employment, but it has seen no uptake. Councils were promised £530 million for superfast broadband, but only £3 million has been disbursed so far. While they claim to want increased infrastructure investment, a £1 billion reduction in capital spending was revealed yesterday. They pledged to reduce borrowing, but it has increased by £245 billion above their forecast. Does this not suggest that they are engaging in posturing rather than effective governance? Their actions amount to rhetoric rather than results. It is not only the Chancellor’s Byron burger initiative that lacked substance—it reflects the entire Government’s approach.",Conflict
"I commend my right hon. Friend not only for his proposals but also for his skill in uniting Members from across all parties who support leaving the European Union with a negotiated agreement. Our discussions today will be watched closely by our European Union counterparts, and their confidence in our capacity to approve the final deal will depend on whether they trust the House to endorse it. I suggest to my right hon. Friend the consideration of a vote in the House to evaluate his negotiating approach and to show our European Union colleagues that it has our backing.",Conflict
"Does my hon. Friend also feel concerned that Members of this House who support remaining, and who represent areas that voted to leave, readily seize upon partial economic data and claim extensive knowledge of intricate economic methods, yet seem unable to grasp the straightforward fact of the referendum result, which was that 52% voted to leave?",Conflict
"In conclusion, I would like to tell the right hon. Gentleman that the time has come to move beyond the issue of who supported leave or remain in the referendum. We ought to unite and set aside the divisions, including those divisions being encouraged by some members in this Chamber. I also remind him that having the backing of Parliament during these negotiations, and acknowledging that ultimately the Government must report to Parliament on the outcomes they secure, is not a vulnerability for the nation but rather an advantage. It would be beneficial for the Government to acknowledge this as soon as possible.",Conflict

Both assertions cannot be accurate, Chancellor.",Conflict
"Prime Minister, the challenge you currently confront concerns the withdrawal agreement and the involvement of Northern Ireland in these negotiations. Over the weekend, the Irish Government stated clearly that the entire basis of the withdrawal agreement rests on uncertain ground. It was asserted that no checks will be imposed on the Irish border; consequently, there will be no risk to peace in Northern Ireland, and no disruption across the island of Ireland. Today, you have indicated that this is due to Northern Ireland not being ready, yet all preparations undertaken by the central Government also apply to Northern Ireland. When will you cease using Northern Ireland as a justification, and do you acknowledge that the significance of this agreement to achieving Brexit, as well as to the integrity of the United Kingdom, means that we will not be subjected to intimidation tactics to force its acceptance?",Conflict
"Does the Minister acknowledge that the proportion of convictions related to identification fraud in votes cast last year was 0.000002%—I mention this figure carefully to avoid omitting any zeros? Although it is evident that electoral fraud must be addressed with due seriousness, could she clarify why a comparable level of attention has not been applied, for example, to investigating the extensive cheating that occurred during the EU referendum campaign?",Conflict
"I fully concur. My hon. Friend raises an additional point concerning the Government’s ongoing challenges in comprehending and effectively supporting the international sector. This is why it is particularly disappointing that the Minister is not willing—or indeed able—to take further steps. The reality is that he and his colleagues have been constrained by directives from No. 10 and the Home Office. This reflects the division within the Conservative party and its members on this matter. As highlighted by the hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh), who is retiring, in The Times today, the situation is one of considerable disorder. Labour, when in government, would not have been part of such a situation.

Throughout this election campaign, we will persist in advocating for the exclusion of students from net migration figures for public policy purposes. While I genuinely acknowledge the establishment of the new designated body mentioned by the Minister, the situation remains as the hon. Member for Bedford indicated: the Minister lacks a clear mechanism of support to achieve the objective that he likely wishes to accomplish through this arrangement.",Conflict
"The Liberal Democrats have maintained a steady stance supporting an in/out referendum either during significant, fundamental treaty amendments or when there is a transfer of powers, which must occur according to treaty requirements. This has been our consistent position, and it remains so today. [Interruption.] Does the hon. Member for South East Cornwall (Sheryll Murray) wish to indicate any occasion when we have expressed a different view? She does not; I assumed as much.",Conflict
"I inform my hon. Friend that the suggestion of establishing a comprehensive customs union has been raised multiple times over several months. This matter has not been sufficiently explored due to the Prime Minister’s stance; it is not connected to the Opposition. To clarify: we will not risk our entire future on the outcome of a Conservative party leadership election, over which most Members have no control and can only watch.

Given the lack of necessary clarity and protections within the political declaration, we should not support this withdrawal agreement. The vote taking place today is an inadequate strategy by the Government attempting to avoid acknowledging that a substantive vote on both the political declaration and the withdrawal agreement must return to the House. For a considerable period, the Prime Minister’s agreement has caused division and disagreement, at a time when unity was needed to move forward. It is in the national interest to build agreement on a future that protects the jobs and welfare of all our constituents. For these reasons, the House should reject this motion.",Conflict
"There is a straightforward and fundamental point that the hon. Lady appears to have overlooked: the European Union cannot negotiate and formalise the legal agreement of the future trade relationship with the United Kingdom while we remain members of the European Union. Such negotiations can only commence once we have departed from the EU. Therefore, if she wishes for us to begin discussions on the future relationship, she should support the deal being presented this evening. This will allow us to proceed to the next phase.

While the backstop is significant, it was not the sole issue raised by hon. Members. Another matter concerned the political declaration, as the hon. Lady suggested in her question, since it outlines a range of potential outcomes. Members sought assurances about the nature of the future relationship that the Government intends to negotiate.",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to the Leader of the House for setting out the rather limited agenda for the forthcoming week. While this is a regular observation, this coming week is particularly notable. Norman Lamont once characterized the equally troubled and disorderly Major administration by stating that

“they give the impression of being in office but not in power”.

In contrast, this Government fails even to convey the appearance of being in office, let alone of holding power. Initially, they declined to participate in votes on Opposition day motions; now they simply abstain from voting altogether.

With the Democratic Unionist Party’s support effectively withdrawn, the Government is beginning to confront the realities of a minority administration, recognizing that securing passage of legislation through the House is no longer guaranteed. Their only potential safeguard appears to be Labour’s lack of discipline and insufficient turnout among its members. Notably, we succeeded in passing two amendments to the Finance Bill on Tuesday, surpassing what was achieved in the previous two decades, so commendations to what might be termed a government in name only. Might we arrange a debate on parliamentary democracy to clarify the Government’s stance on the fundamental principle of voting?",Conflict
"That statement is entirely incorrect. The right hon. Gentleman is fully aware that our opinions on Brexit are strongly divergent. I believe the EU, acting in good faith, would probably agree to a sincere request for an extension, for example, to hold a people’s vote. In the end, it will be the responsibility of the House to determine, should such a recommendation be presented, whether it should not be implemented into law.",Conflict
"I am not speaking about the hurried and deceptive nature of the June 2016 referendum, but rather about the two significant referendums held in Wales specifically concerning devolution, which followed many years of thorough debate and campaigning. These referendums were not a reaction to Brexit, whose implications are only now becoming somewhat clearer; they directly addressed the issue of devolution itself. It may be necessary to remind members of the Government Front Bench of the outcomes of these votes regarding the preferred form of government in Wales and the powers it should hold. The first referendum, held in 1997, passed by a narrow margin, while the second, which proposed a modest increase in powers, was approved by a large majority in 2011, with support from all parties. The campaign opposing it had become fragmented and disconnected—I regret that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) is not present to respond to this point.",Conflict
"Regarding the issue of a second referendum—[Interruption.] Which scenario is more detrimental? I have addressed this question on numerous occasions. The choice the hon. Lady offers effectively boils down to no deal versus no Brexit, with a second referendum serving as a stand-in for the latter. As the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) has remarked, a second vote essentially functions as a means to halt Brexit. If a Member from the shadow Minister’s own side can acknowledge this truth, then she ought to be equally straightforward. To respond to her inquiry, between those two alternatives, I regard no Brexit as the less favorable outcome compared to no deal. While no deal would cause disruption—which I have openly communicated to colleagues within my party—the shadow Minister has persistently voted against any deal, and it is the deal that would have protected the interests of sectors such as the chemicals industry.",Conflict
"The nation appears to be divided between those who cannot accept the outcome of the referendum and anticipate that Brexit will have entirely negative consequences for the UK, and those who believe, without basis, that exiting the European Union without an agreement would cause no difficulties. The reality is that having a deal would be more advantageous, which is why the Government seeks to secure an agreement with the European Union. I continue to encourage Members of the Opposition to back this effort. Failure to do so will result in the uncertainties they have mentioned today.",Conflict
"Shortly before Christmas, we erred by narrowly approving a motion that requires Parliament to give final consent to any agreement. This decision has reduced the leverage of our negotiators. The European Union now understands that any agreement reached may still be rejected, which could encourage them to negotiate more firmly. To offer a brief comparison, if I were to negotiate buying your car, Madam Deputy Speaker, regardless of any unusual sticker on the windshield, both parties have clear interests: I want the car, and you want the payment. From the beginning, both sides must be ready to walk away if necessary. This is the point emphasized by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood), and it reflects standard business practice. To conclude with another comparison, one does not reveal their cards in a game of poker.",Conflict
"Fundamentally, this Bill is highly unadvisable, to say the least, and from a practical perspective, it is also ill-conceived and likely to have adverse effects. As my right hon. and learned Friend stated, a lasting resolution cannot be achieved through a one-sided effort to enforce one party’s preferences on a jointly agreed international treaty. Naturally, there is no basis to expect that this will alter the EU’s stance regarding Northern Ireland. Why would it? The EU’s issue lies with the UK’s perceived lack of reliability, and rather than alleviating this concern, the Bill serves to deepen it. Should the EU, by chance, offer a concession in response—if it were to reach a new agreement with the UK due to the pressure this legislation is meant to exert—what reason would there be to trust that the UK would honour such an agreement? The entire premise for trust would already be undermined. Moreover, as has been discussed earlier today, this represents only the initial stage of the possible complications that could arise.",Conflict
"Prior to delving into the complexities of referendums and the arguments surrounding Brexit, it is worth acknowledging that European influence has long been embedded in our language, evident in terms such as Spanish omelettes, German measles, Dutch auctions, and, more provocatively, French letters and French kissing—appropriate examples given the subject of European matters.

What was once regarded as a distant continent across the Channel, regarded with mild curiosity, is now by many being portrayed as a threatening entity to be feared and criticised. It is unfortunate that the term “Europe” tends to evoke a range of reactions. Critics often highlight concerns primarily related to migration, which serves as a stand-in for various other issues, yet Europe encompasses many aspects extending well beyond this single focus.",Conflict
"Sixty-two per cent of individuals in Scotland voted to remain, so I am content to be among that group. Approximately 7,500 of his constituents and 14,500 of mine have endorsed the petition to revoke article 50. The right hon.

"Today’s debate has included many valuable remarks, with significant points raised by Members across the House, and I will endeavour to address as many as possible within the time allotted. As numerous Members have indicated, this Budget appears to lack sufficient urgency, a criticism voiced not only by the Opposition during the discussion. This sense of complacency was perhaps most evident in the Chancellor’s evaluation of the nation’s economic condition, and I was taken aback to hear a similar view expressed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Known for his attention to detail, he suggested this afternoon that the Government’s economic projections might be adjusted upwards if a favourable agreement were reached with the EU. However, those projections already assume that a deal similar to that proposed by the Prime Minister will be secured with the EU, a position that many Conservative Backbenchers are evidently contesting. Such confidence may be considered highly imprudent.",Conflict
"The Leader of the House appears to assume that we lack awareness, but we will not be misled by a dissolution motion that has previously been requested and that could enable him to force a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. Why does he not release the motion at this time so that it can be examined? Can he clarify whether the motion will be open to amendments, and indicate when he intends to present it?",Conflict
"The referendums held in 1975 and 2016 share several similarities. In 1972, Prime Minister Ted Heath led the country into the common market without consulting the public through a referendum. Subsequently, Harold Wilson pledged to hold a referendum once he had renegotiated the terms. The British electorate supported this approach, resulting in Wilson’s election victory in 1974 and a vote in favour of remaining in the common market in the subsequent referendum. Moving ahead to 2015, David Cameron, concerned about the rising influence of Nigel Farage and UKIP, appeared to draw on this historical precedent by promising a referendum during the upcoming election campaign. Cameron’s strategy succeeded in securing a Conservative majority, the first since 1992. While the initial stage of Cameron’s plan was effective, the outcome differed in that he was unable to convince the public to adopt the position he believed was in the national interest.",Conflict
"I am concerned that this Bill may serve as a diversion from the primary objective of pursuing the best possible agreement on the Northern Ireland protocol. There is also a risk that it could give Unionist communities the mistaken belief that a straightforward, absolute solution exists, when in fact, following scrutiny by the House of Lords, legal challenges, and responses from the EU, a negotiated compromise will be necessary. Our attention should be directed entirely towards encouraging the EU to engage in talks aimed at securing the required adjustments for Northern Ireland, including input from the right hon. Member’s party.

There is a danger that this approach could further complicate ongoing discussions with the EU and its member states, and extend uncertainty for businesses in Northern Ireland. Additionally, it may expose the UK as a whole to the threat of retaliatory trade measures. This may also reinforce the perspective held by many moderate voters in Northern Ireland that efforts to conclude Brexit by abolishing the protocol may not align with their interests. It is crucial to consider this challenge of winning public support as we work to maintain the Union.",Conflict
"Regarding the European referendum and the strategy for securing a victory, the most detrimental outcome for the campaign advocating continued membership in Europe would be if a succession of the Chancellor’s establishment representatives were to insist to the public that withdrawal from the European Union is unfeasible and that survival outside it is impossible. While I am a committed supporter of the European Union, I cannot endorse, nor see justification for, a scenario in which the establishment collectively asserts that the UK’s exit from the Union is unattainable. Such a top-down approach by the establishment would likely generate significant discontent and provoke a backlash among individuals who value their independence.",Conflict
"Allow me to recap the key points made by those speakers who articulated this perspective most effectively. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), the shadow Home Secretary, clearly explained that this agreement endangers all the collaboration with the European Union that we have come to depend on in areas such as justice, security, and policing, and therefore it is unacceptable. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) noted, in his characteristically engaging speech, that the problems concerning the Northern Ireland border remain completely unresolved. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) highlighted the crucial observation—one that I am confident many Conservative Members share—that the current deal does not provide control over our laws, borders, or finances. Rather, it transfers control to Europe by denying us influence over these matters.",Conflict
"Is the Prime Minister aware that when Jean-Claude Juncker described her as “nebulous,” he significantly misjudged the perspective of the British public, who do not share that view? Over the weekend, I heard from constituents who commended the Prime Minister’s resolve to secure a deal beneficial to my area. Will she show the same resolve by rejecting the possibility of a second referendum, which would be deeply offensive to my constituents and imply that their initial vote was uninformed?",Conflict
"It is widely recognized, whether accurately or not, that a significant number of individuals who would choose to leave the European Union do so due to concerns about immigration levels.

Member for Moray (Douglas Ross) acknowledged the sovereignty of the Scottish people. This acknowledgment might be unexpected for some of his colleagues representing English constituencies who are not present this evening and who frequently assert that sovereignty lies solely with this Parliament. Nevertheless, he has made that concession, representing one such concession from the Government Benches.",Conflict
"Secondly, I wish to address a more local issue. While the rest of the country awaits a formal in/out referendum, north Northamptonshire is already conducting its own version of such a referendum. This effort is being led in Kettering by my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), in my own constituency by myself, and in the Corby constituency by Thomas Pursglove, the Conservative candidate, who, I am pleased to inform the Prime Minister, shares a Eurosceptic stance similar to mine and that of my hon. Friend the Member for Kettering. We are distributing 250,000 ballot papers posing the straightforward question of whether the residents of north Northamptonshire wish to remain in or leave the EU. We intend to complete this referendum by the end of the year and submit the results to Downing Street. Based on the ballots returned so far, I believe approximately 85% support leaving the EU.",Conflict
"I offer my congratulations to my right hon. Friend, both for his proposals and for his ability to bring together members across all parties who back leaving the European Union with an agreement. Our debates today will be observed attentively by our European Union counterparts, and the outcome of negotiations will hinge on their confidence that the House will endorse the final agreement. I propose to my right hon. Friend that conducting a vote in the House to evaluate his negotiating strategy could be advantageous and would demonstrate to our European Union partners that we present a united front in backing the process.",Conflict

"I have observed the ongoing contest between the two parties across the Chamber regarding which is the legitimate Opposition. It appears likely that this dispute will persist for quite some time. My message to the House is that during this period, we will continue to govern the country and act in the best interests of our constituents.

The hon. Member referred to the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s speech at the Mansion House last evening and mentioned austerity. I believe there is a fundamental and straightforward principle involved here: it is prudent for individuals to live within their financial means. That is what we advocate. It is his party that promotes imprudence, which contributed to the difficulties the country faced initially. It is entirely appropriate that we adopt a responsible approach moving forward. I regret that Scottish nationalists appear not to grasp this.

With regard to the European Union Referendum Bill, I am aware of the amendments submitted by SNP Members. These will be considered in debate next week, and the House’s position on them will then be clear.",Conflict
"Rather than expressing dissatisfaction with the draft withdrawal agreement released this morning, which suggests maintaining Northern Ireland’s participation in the customs union, the single energy market, and adherence to EU regulations on the environment and agriculture, should Ministers not acknowledge that the core issue stems from their ongoing inability to clarify how they intend to preserve an open border while exiting the customs union and single market? At what point will they provide an explanation of their proposed approach to this challenge?",Conflict
"Another matter that I anticipate may encounter significant obstacles in the near future is the proposed devolution for East Anglia. For those with a particular interest in this relatively specialized topic, there is a notably clear and succinct article in this week’s edition of The House magazine explaining why the proposal is fundamentally flawed. I will refrain from further comment, but it bears the influence of a well-known, high-profile former Deputy Prime Minister who has recently been quite vocal. I do not believe the plan will succeed. While I am in favour of the northern powerhouse initiative and devolution arrangements for Greater Birmingham and Greater Manchester, the case for East Anglia does not hold up. It lacks public support, is costly, and has not been properly costed, so I urge the Government to abandon these proposals.",Conflict
"The subject of today’s discussion concerns the United Kingdom’s role on the international stage, a position that has arguably been significantly weakened under the current administration. This weakening appears to stem not from the UK population or those who voted to leave the EU, but rather from the persistent shortcomings of those who promoted an unrealistic vision of Brexit and lack a clear plan for its implementation. Furthermore, this diminished standing is evident even to those whom Brexit supporters believe will compensate for reduced ties with neighbouring countries. It is worth noting that former Australian Prime Minister Gillard has remarked:

“I do worry that people are starting to imagine that a trade deal with Australia is somehow a substitute for being on the doorstep of a market with 500 million people—it’s not.”

Her observation is accurate. Additionally, it is noteworthy that Canada’s Globe and Mail recently issued an apology for having described the Government’s Brexit strategy as a total “omnishambles” six months prior, when it suggested the situation could not deteriorate further—yet it has. The newspaper demonstrated accountability by correcting its earlier statement.",Conflict
"The danger posed by Daesh and its associated groups remains, now evident in attacks occurring in European cities. The broader instability in the Middle East continues, with no progress towards resolving the Israel-Palestine issue. North Korea has shown its resolve to disregard international law by advancing its nuclear weapons program and developing ballistic missiles capable of delivering them. Russia similarly displays determination through its ongoing destabilisation efforts in Ukraine and its unlawful control of Crimea. Tensions are escalating in the South China Sea. The migration situation in the eastern and central Mediterranean is creating new difficulties for nearby European countries. With the referendum just over four weeks away, the mere possibility of the United Kingdom voting to leave the European Union is already impacting economic growth, as well as business and consumer confidence. In all directions, the global environment is becoming more hazardous and uncertain.",Conflict
"No. According to Conservative party criteria, we currently have a moderate and sensible Europe Minister occupying a position on the Front Bench, who over time has thoughtfully considered the perspectives of most individuals regarding European matters. It is somewhat unexpected that a person of his standing is undertaking not only the responsibilities of an effective Europe Minister, which he fulfills, but also the more unpleasant tasks for the Conservative party, creating the impression that, as a reasonable individual, he is overlooking the significant conditions outlined by the Electoral Commission.

Lastly, any discussion about leaving the European Union should emphasize that such a departure would require negotiation. Perhaps the appropriate question is, “Should the UK engage in negotiations to exit the European Union under article 50 of the Lisbon treaty?” Any such inquiry ought to explicitly acknowledge that the UK is currently a member of the European Union, and the issue at hand is whether the UK should continue its membership.",Conflict
"We observed this conduct in full effect when the NHS Reinstatement Bill was subject to a filibuster. While it is within their rights according to House rules, they certainly made extensive use of those provisions. Why do these particular rules only govern private Members’ Bills? Other legislation progressing through the House is appropriately scheduled and controlled. This practice needs to be discontinued, especially as there is growing interest among our constituents regarding private Members’ Bills. I acknowledge that the Procedure Committee is examining this issue, but a clear and firm statement from the Leader of the House and the Government indicating that such actions are unacceptable would be very useful in helping to alter this approach.",Conflict
"Those of us backing Labour’s motion have been accused of being remoaners using parliamentary procedures to postpone the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. Although the Government has now consented to our motion, we continue to receive criticism for seeking extensive transparency or for possibly endangering their prospects of securing the most favourable result. It has been indicated that no further commentary will be provided. In her consistently strong speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) highlighted the importance of obtaining clear responses to key issues. She raised questions that some might find challenging but which require attention, and I commend her for doing so.",Conflict
"Motion (E) presents a chance both to advance the Prime Minister’s agreement and to enable those opposed to triggering article 50 to revoke it. I am prepared to take that risk and place the issue before the public, having lost confidence that Parliament will secure a majority for the deal I support. I find myself with two alternatives: either to participate in meaningful vote number 3,029, or—as someone who previously worked as a transactional lawyer on a trading floor—to look forward and seek a resolution that achieves my objective, which is to respect the 2016 referendum result. This matter is very important to me, and I am concerned about the democratic shortfall if it is not fulfilled.

Naturally, some may question why we are returning to the electorate. I say this with considerable reluctance, but my support stems solely from Parliament’s inability to reach a majority and make a decision—we are at an impasse. Each Member of this House must confront the reality and consider, “How much longer can this deadlock continue? How much uncertainty are we willing to impose on businesses and our constituents before accepting that an alternative approach is necessary?”",Conflict
"I will also be opposing the motion today, as I believe it to be entirely unnecessary. I speak as someone who voted to leave on 23 June last year and who has held a reluctant respect for the Prime Minister’s conduct since she assumed office. Nevertheless, her reasoning for calling a general election is, frankly, misleading. The claim that she requires a fresh mandate to negotiate Brexit is unfounded. That mandate was granted on 24 June by a majority of the British electorate, and it is her responsibility to implement it. Should she choose to hold another election or referendum at the conclusion of the process, that is a separate matter, but as my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick) pointed out, justifying it at this stage is purely opportunistic.",Conflict
"As my respected colleague is aware, a commitment made in the 2019 manifesto was to lower the total figures related to migration and to address the issue of unlawful migration. Both he and I advocated for leaving the European Union, and 17 million individuals voted in favour of having control over national borders. This is what the Government intends to implement.",Conflict
"Given the situation, where the agreement has broken down amid some disagreement, how probable is it that the European Council would reach a unanimous decision to permit the UK to remain a member beyond the initial two-year timeframe? My assessment is that this is highly improbable. If, for the sake of argument, such an outcome were to be achieved, we must consider what would follow in that scenario. One outcome is certain: legal proceedings would ensue. Ultimately, the matter would be referred to the Supreme Court to determine the question, ""Has the Prime Minister taken a decision, or has the Prime Minister failed to do so?"" The ruling could go one of two ways. I believe that Members from both sides of the House would concur that the Supreme Court must conclude either that the Prime Minister has made the decision or that the Prime Minister has not made the decision.",Conflict
"With due respect to my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), we now proceed to discuss the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. I clearly recall his remarks to me as we approached the Third Reading of that Bill, and I believe he would not contest this accurate summary of our exchange. He stated, “You know, I have never previously voted against a provision of this nature. I have never cast a vote contrary to what I view as the interests and aims of the European Union.” I acknowledge that position, as he has been consistently steadfast, and I hold that in regard. Nonetheless, the fact remains that he did vote in favour of that Bill at Third Reading, as did every other Conservative Member.",Conflict

"In 2014, as has been noted, Scotland voted to stay within the United Kingdom, doing so based on the assurance that the only way to maintain our membership in the EU was by voting against independence. Then, in 2016, another referendum took place, and Scotland—including my constituency and all others in Scotland—chose to remain in the EU. Given that the Prime Minister has led us towards this disorderly no-deal situation, I had intended to ask whether he had prepared sufficiently for the consequences, but it appears that such preparation is unnecessary. Therefore, I ask: how does he begin to justify the severe difficulties he is about to impose on my constituents; and, furthermore, how does he assess their capacity for acceptance of this outcome?",Conflict
"In our attempts, we directly appealed to the Prime Minister during meetings and presented her with a potential solution, recognizing that, for instance, the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, and numerous Labour Back Benchers would have supported remaining in the single market and customs union. A consensus could have been reached, yet she categorically declined to engage in that process. Instead, this Prime Minister has guided us—indeed, the sole area in which she has taken the lead—into this difficult situation. She was unwavering in establishing her red lines, and at every opportunity to modify or relax those boundaries, she chose not to do so.",Conflict

Northern Ireland is set to continue following EU single market regulations regarding goods and agricultural products, whereas the remainder of the UK will not. As noted by the right hon.

On Saturday, the Prime Minister assured the House that no inspections would be required on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, yesterday the Brexit Secretary informed the Lords European Union Committee that businesses in Northern Ireland sending goods to Great Britain would need to complete export declaration paperwork. Which of these statements is accurate: the Prime Minister’s or the Brexit Secretary’s? Both cannot be correct.",Conflict
"The cessation of security cooperation with Ireland is unacceptable and is not beneficial to Northern Ireland or the union.

I am aware from last week’s statement that, rather than addressing substantial questions, the Minister opts to resort to rehearsed criticisms and silencing tactics, but today is not the occasion for such approaches. Can the Minister provide a clear response to the House? Is it the Government’s formal stance to terminate negotiations with the EU and to pursue a departure on 31 October without an agreement? If this is not the case, will the Government either suggest an alternative framework for discussions with the EU or clarify that it will seek an immediate extension, as mandated by the Benn Act, on 19 October? The House and the public require a straightforward response.

"Is it not true that Her Majesty’s Government have consistently been reluctant to permit an impartial and objective evaluation of the costs and advantages of our membership, which accounts for their concern over the response to my hon. Friend’s question? Today, we have again heard the latest statements from Her Majesty’s Government suggesting that if we were to leave the European Union, the value of the pound would decline and holidays in Europe would become more costly. I had understood that it was a convention for Her Majesty’s Government, particularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to refrain from making predictions about future exchange rate movements, so does this not indicate that we have entered a period of political messaging due to their apprehension about independent, objective analysis?",Conflict
"One of the outcomes anticipated from Brexit was the necessity to establish a trade border between the United Kingdom and the European Union, with only two possible locations for this border: either in the Irish Sea or on the land border within the island of Ireland. Given that the Government is currently attempting to alter the agreement that places the trade border in the Irish Sea, what alternative is being actively considered—introducing a land border on the island of Ireland, or reintegrating the entire UK, rather than solely Northern Ireland, into the single market?",Conflict
"The hon. Lady may express disagreement, but the policy is fundamentally established in the context of the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU. This concerns an immigration framework controlled by a British Government, no longer bound by EU laws, regulations, or alignment. This represents a significant shift and a substantial change. The system is designed to restore control, as the British Government has stated, over our borders and to enable the admission of the most skilled individuals through a tiered, points-based system, as detailed in the policy document.

The new framework will reduce dependence on low-skilled labour, and it is important that the hon. Lady supports the Government’s shared objective of promoting higher wages. The aim is to foster a high-skilled economy rather than one characterised by low pay. Regarding social care, it is not classified as low-skilled labour. Those working in social care should receive appropriate remuneration, and it is appropriate that employers invest in training to ensure the delivery of compassionate care.

It appears that the Labour party has not fully acknowledged the views expressed by the British electorate in the general election and the 2016 referendum, and continues to advocate for open borders and a less regulated immigration approach.",Conflict
"Let us present the affirmative argument for continued membership in the European Union. I am keen to see a thorough and extended discussion, as I believe Members from both sides of the House desire as well. I trust they will support us when the time comes to decide on the referendum date. Let us consider areas where increased European integration might be beneficial. I do not believe we should shy away from this on matters such as climate change—an acknowledged reality—alongside security policies and related topics. Equally, let us discuss areas where less European involvement may be appropriate. We have already mentioned fisheries as an example. It is important to remember that it was not the European Union but the United Kingdom Government, which claimed to represent Scottish fishermen, that referred to them as expendable. On that note, I will conclude. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",Conflict
"Does the Prime Minister now acknowledge that his efforts to pressure leaders into accepting his flawed reforms have been unsuccessful, resulting in very limited progress?

Achieving change requires patient and constructive diplomacy, as well as building alliances. [Interruption.] It is true that we all value our allies. However, the Prime Minister appears to prioritise his party’s interests over this; he is engaging in political manoeuvring rather than advancing the interests of the nation.

Can the Prime Minister clarify whether his Government will take a position on the choice facing the public in the upcoming referendum, and how that position will be determined and communicated? What response has he provided to Lord Heseltine’s warning that Britain could become “a laughing stock across the world” if the Prime Minister proceeds with the announcement made today?

Considering the European Union at this delicate juncture, I perceive it as a fragile structure, and if the UK withdraws its foundational role, there is a considerable risk that the entire system could collapse. What begins as a domestic economic issue could escalate into an international and global economic challenge, accompanied by political and security implications. The national economy and our security outlook could be significantly impacted.",Economic
"The effects on automobile manufacturers have not been adequately addressed. This matter extends beyond simply establishing new trade opportunities globally; it concerns a supply chain that is intricately integrated throughout Europe. For example, a standard drive shaft for a family sedan is produced across six different European countries. What options will car manufacturers have if tariffs are introduced between the UK and the EU? Just last night, I spoke with a multinational retailer employing 3,000 people who is relocating to a new site with 5,000 employees. These workers relocate among cities such as London, Frankfurt, and Paris in the same way people move from North Yorkshire to London, yet they may soon face barriers preventing such movement. How have these considerations been overlooked in making this decision, without addressing these questions?

There is a broader concern as well. Observing the European Union at this sensitive moment, I see it as a fragile structure, and if the UK withdraws its foundational support, there is a considerable risk that the entire system could collapse. What begins as a domestic economic concern has the potential to escalate into an international and global economic challenge, coupled with political and security risks. This could have significant consequences for the UK’s economy and national security outlook.",Economic

"I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond).

I express my gratitude to the Backbench Business Committee and to the three sponsors who have arranged today’s debate to bring this matter before the House. The financial services industry in the UK represents a significant strength and is recognised globally for its excellence. Within the OECD, the UK’s financial sector ranks as the third largest in terms of economic output. According to recent assessments, London’s financial market is the second most competitive worldwide, just behind New York. Consequently, it is expected that London dominates within the UK itself. The city accounts for half of the financial sector’s economic output nationally, while Scotland, notably, follows closely behind London and the south-east as a well-established financial hub. Therefore, although London remains the primary focus, the contributions from other parts of the UK deserve recognition as well.",Economic

Central to this argument should be the entrepreneurs, small enterprises, start-ups, and innovators.

The Government ought to reconsider the emphasis on shareholder value as the exclusive objective for companies. While simplifying the governance code is important, it is equally necessary to strengthen oversight so that excesses are more effectively controlled and companies are held more responsible for the wider effects of their activities. Actions are needed to reduce the influence of crony capitalism, address problematic privatisations, prevent public contracts from being consistently awarded to the same dominant conglomerates, avoid the socialisation of losses arising from private risk-taking, and review existing corporate tax incentives.",Economic

"It is the duty of any Government to safeguard its population from various threats to society, including those related to national security, economic stability, or social unity.

Ten years later, a number of members on the Government side now support a no-deal Brexit, which I consider likely to deepen public distress—a scenario that the Bank of England warns could lead to conditions more severe than those experienced during the 2008 financial collapse.

It is uncommon for both the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress to hold a unified position, yet they are both opposed to a no-deal Brexit. The current situation is more severe than in 2008 because the Government would be intentionally imposing such an outcome on the UK economy and, consequently, on communities across the country.

"Under legal arrangements largely similar to the 1957 treaty, an individual was ultimately extradited to the USA to face terrorism-related charges following an arrest requested by the USA. Is it desirable to encounter situations akin to the Abu Hamza case repeatedly in our extradition procedures? These instances are not unique in demonstrating the advantages of the European arrest warrant; many other examples exist.

The European arrest warrant is financially efficient. Reverting to a mechanism like that of 1957 would require covering extensive legal expenses for extradition cases that could extend over years, costing the public treasury hundreds of thousands of pounds. Both the public and members of the judiciary express frustration over the frequent delays of several years in extraditing terrorists. Returning to the 1957 process could result in such prolonged procedures becoming standard practice. While this may not have been a significant issue decades ago when cross-border criminal activity was less common, it is now a frequent occurrence.

In its submissions to the House of Lords and Parliament, ACPO stated:

“The view therefore of ACPO is simple. The EAW works very effectively and increases the safety of the UK public. It is for this reason that ACPO strongly supports the EAW.”",Economic

Is it desirable to encounter situations akin to the Abu Hamza case within our extradition procedures? These instances are not unique in demonstrating the advantages of the European arrest warrant; many additional cases could be referenced.

The European arrest warrant operates in a cost-effective manner. Reverting to a system based on the 1957 framework would obligate us to bear the legal expenses of extradition proceedings that could extend over several years and incur costs amounting to hundreds of thousands of pounds to the public purse. Both the judiciary and the public express frustration over the frequent lengthy delays in extraditing terrorists. Returning to the 1957 process risks making these protracted procedures standard practice. While this may have been less problematic several decades ago when cross-border criminal activity was less common, it has become a regular occurrence today.

"Let us consider the automotive sector. Should the UK exit, it would encounter tariffs of 10%. The expectation is that this will be managed through labour market adaptability, which effectively means reductions in wages. Since wages constitute only one-third of overall costs, workers would need to accept a 30% decrease in pay or face unemployment. Approximately 450,000 jobs are at potential risk.

This would ensure both a clear emphasis on the statutory procedure to be followed and that the only situations in which it is not adhered to—using clause 9 as an example—are those where obtaining an extension under article 50 to allow the statutory process to be completed before departure would be unfeasible. By doing so, the House would engage in productive dialogue rather than the partisan arguments that have dominated recent days.",Conflict
"Allow me to put forward the case in favour of maintaining membership in the European Union. I welcome a comprehensive and detailed debate, which I believe Members across the House also wish to see. I anticipate their support when the proposal to set a date for the referendum is brought forward. Let us examine instances where deeper European cooperation could prove advantageous. I do not think we should avoid such discussions on issues like climate change—which is widely recognised as a fact—as well as on security and related matters. Similarly, it is worth exploring situations where a reduced European role might be suitable. Fisheries have already been cited as an example. It is important to recall that it was the UK Government, rather than the European Union, which described Scottish fishermen as dispensable. With that, I will end my remarks. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",Conflict
"As previously mentioned, in 2014 Scotland voted to remain part of the United Kingdom, doing so on the understanding that the only way to retain membership in the EU was to reject independence. Subsequently, in 2016, another referendum was held, in which Scotland—including my constituency and all others within Scotland—voted to stay in the EU. Since the Prime Minister has directed us toward this disorderly no-deal exit, I had intended to inquire whether adequate preparations had been made for the resulting consequences; however, it seems such preparations are not in place. Consequently, I ask: on what basis does he justify the significant challenges he is about to impose on my constituents, and how does he evaluate their willingness to accept this outcome?",Conflict
"The discontinuation of security collaboration with Ireland is unacceptable and does not serve the interests of Northern Ireland or the union.

I note from last week’s statement that, instead of addressing significant issues, the Minister chose to rely on familiar criticisms and attempts to suppress debate, but today is not the time for such tactics. Can the Minister provide a clear answer to the House? Does the Government officially intend to end negotiations with the EU and proceed with a departure on 31 October without a deal? If that is not the case, will the Government propose an alternative negotiation framework with the EU or confirm that it will seek an immediate extension, as required by the Benn Act, on 19 October? The House and the public need a direct response.

I accept that the Minister frames his remarks as a formal statement or reassuring message about preparedness for a no-deal outcome, but I remind the House that he used similar language last week at the Dispatch Box when he said:

“The automotive sector…confirmed that it was ready. The retail sector has confirmed that it is ready.” — [Official Report, 25 September 2019; Vol. 664, c. 722.]

As the Minister knows, this statement provoked a significant reaction during the debate. Within hours, the British Retail Consortium issued a statement disputing that claim, stating:",Conflict
"Does my honorable Friend also feel frustrated by the stance taken by the Opposition parties, especially the Scottish National Party, which appears to focus more on creating conflict and division within our United Kingdom rather than prioritizing the national interest?

"Another matter that, I must say, is likely to encounter difficulties in the near future is East Anglian devolution. For those with a particular interest in this somewhat specialized topic, there is a notably clear and succinct article in this week’s edition of The House magazine explaining why it is a complete mess. I will refrain from elaborating further, but it bears the influence of a well-known, prominent, and recently vocal former Deputy Prime Minister. I do not believe it will succeed. While I am in favour of the northern powerhouse and devolution for Greater Birmingham and Greater Manchester, the proposal for East Anglia does not add up. It lacks support, is unpopular, costly, and lacks a financial assessment, and the Government should abandon the plans.",Conflict
"The Leader of the House seems to believe that we are uninformed, yet we will not be deceived by a dissolution motion that has already been requested and might allow him to impose a no-deal Brexit by 31 October. Why does he not make the motion available now so that it can be reviewed? Can he specify whether the motion will permit amendments, and inform us when he plans to introduce it?",Conflict
"A number of members have raised concerns today about the restricted scrutiny and the inadequate time provided for the consideration of this Bill. My right hon. Friend has pointed out that Scotland has been neglected in this process—a nation that voted predominantly to remain in the EU. Would he agree with me that, in this context, there continues to be a propensity to conveniently ignore the fact that the referendum outcome was determined by a very narrow margin throughout the UK? The Electoral Commission has indicated that there were breaches of electoral law, yet this matter has been overlooked, causing me to question the legitimacy of the result as a whole.",Conflict
"We have received a number of valuable contributions today, highlighting significant points from members on both sides of the House, and I will endeavour to address as many as time permits. As several Members have indicated, this Budget appears to lack urgency, a critique not solely expressed by the Opposition during this discussion. This sense of complacency was perhaps most evident in the Chancellor’s evaluation of the nation’s economic situation, and I was taken aback to hear a similar view expressed by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Known for his attention to detail, he suggested this afternoon that the Government’s economic projections might be adjusted upwards should a favourable agreement be reached with the EU. Yet, these projections already assume that a deal akin to that supported by his Prime Minister will be secured with the EU—a point currently disputed by numerous Conservative Back Benchers. Such confidence could be considered imprudent.",Conflict
"The Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee published a report last week, which received unanimous support from all its members, addressing the topic of disinformation, especially concerning electoral campaigns. In light of this report and the numerous questions related to the leave campaigns, some of which involve allegations of large-scale fraud, could the Prime Minister clarify why she has not yet established a judge-led public inquiry with the authority to call for evidence and witnesses to investigate whether the government is acting based on a fraudulent campaign and an invalid outcome?",Conflict
"Does my hon. Friend also feel frustrated by the stance taken by the Opposition parties, especially the Scottish National Party, who appear more focused on creating disagreement and division within our United Kingdom than on prioritizing the national interest?

"The referendums held in 1975 and 2016 share several similarities. In 1972, Prime Minister Ted Heath led the United Kingdom into the common market without consulting the public through a referendum. Subsequently, Harold Wilson pledged to hold a referendum following renegotiated terms. The electorate supported this approach, resulting in Wilson’s victory in the 1974 election and a majority vote to remain in the subsequent referendum. Moving ahead to 2015, David Cameron, concerned about the political challenge posed by Nigel Farage and UKIP, appeared to draw on this historical precedent by promising a referendum during the general election campaign. This strategy contributed to securing a Conservative majority—something not achieved since 1992. While the initial phase of Mr Cameron’s strategy succeeded, the outcome diverged because he was unable to convince the public to support the course he considered beneficial for the country.",Conflict
"The country appears to be divided between those who, unable to accept the referendum outcome, hold an excessively negative view that Brexit will bring only harm to the UK, and those who hold an overly positive belief that leaving the European Union without a deal would cause no difficulties. The reality is that securing a deal would be preferable, which is why the Government is striving to finalize an agreement with the European Union. I continue to encourage Opposition Members to back this effort. Without such an agreement, the uncertainties they have mentioned today will persist.",Conflict
"Amendment 57 requests an updated strategic defence and security review. The most recent SDSR was informed by the 2015 national security risk assessment, conducted prior to the European referendum and without accounting for any post-Brexit circumstances. Therefore, it is now outdated.

This highlights the inconsistency in the Conservative Party’s approach to Brexit.",Conflict
"Within the Brexit faction, a concerning and troubling anti-intellectual sentiment has become apparent, with further indications emerging this week. Facts are indispensable, and therefore, to ensure the forthcoming vote is well-informed, will the Secretary of State commit to releasing the Government’s own impact assessments regarding the consequences of Brexit prior to the vote?",Conflict
"Is it not true that Her Majesty’s Government have consistently been apprehensive about an impartial and objective evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of our membership, which accounts for their concern regarding the response to my hon. Friend’s question? Just today, we have heard the most recent assertions from Her Majesty’s Government suggesting that, if we were to leave the European Union, the value of the pound would decline and the cost of holidays in Europe would rise. I had understood it to be the established practice of Her Majesty’s Government, particularly the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to refrain from making predictions about future exchange rate movements. Does this not indicate that we have entered a period characterized by political messaging due to their unease with independent objective analysis?",Conflict
"I am not speaking about the hurried and misleading nature of the June 2016 referendum, but rather about the two significant referendums held in Wales specifically concerning devolution, which followed many years of thorough discussions and campaigning. This was not a decision made hastily or as an afterthought when the implications of Brexit were only beginning to emerge; these referendums focused directly on the issue of devolution itself. Perhaps I should remind members of the Government Front Bench of the outcomes of those referendums regarding the preferred form of government in Wales and the extent of powers desired. The first referendum passed narrowly in 1997, and the second, which involved a modest increase in powers, was decisively approved in 2011, enjoying cross-party support, while the opposing campaign had deteriorated into a persistent, misguided, and irrelevant faction—I regret that the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) is not present to respond to this point.",Conflict
"I appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s remarks. Reflecting on the last three years, it is possible to identify actions we might have taken differently or adjustments we could have made.

Speculating with “If? What? Could?” is an engaging exercise—hindsight provides perfect clarity—but it is important to remember that the other 27 member states each maintained their own firm positions. The notion that, had I or the hon. Gentleman assumed the role of UK Prime Minister, all other members would have simply welcomed us and offered an excellent agreement is unrealistic. Those member states would have continued to uphold their respective non-negotiable stances.",Conflict
"As noted, in 2014 Scotland voted to stay within the United Kingdom, doing so with the understanding that a vote against independence was the only way to secure continued EU membership. In 2016, another referendum took place, and Scotland—including my own constituency and all others across Scotland—voted to remain in the European Union. Given the Prime Minister’s actions leading us toward a no-deal scenario, I had intended to ask whether he had prepared adequately for the consequences, but it appears that is unnecessary. Therefore, I ask: on what basis does he justify the severe difficulties he is about to impose on my constituents; and, furthermore, how does he assess their level of credulity?",Conflict
"I will now address the matter of whether the agreement established with Turkey is reasonable. Turkey and the European Union have concluded an agreement that grants Turkey expedited visa access in exchange for aid amounting to £3 billion, along with, as I understand, the possibility of ongoing financial assistance. Additionally, there is the potential for renewed EU membership discussions contingent upon Turkey’s commitment to a migration action plan. I hold a strong skepticism regarding this arrangement. It appears to involve providing funds that resemble a form of inducement to Turkey. Based on information I have received, including from a recent meeting I attended, the Turkish authorities have not consistently fulfilled the enforcement of the agreed measures. The significant number of individuals traveling through Europe towards Germany, causing considerable disruption, is largely attributable to what I perceive as Turkey’s recent lack of effective implementation.",Conflict
"The most notable speech today, in my view, was delivered by my hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)—not only due to its duration but also because of its substance. He presented some learned observations and was notably candid about what the British public might anticipate from the leave campaign regarding the implications of departure. He openly addressed uncertainties related to the common fisheries policy and the common agricultural policy. Given that many currently endorse these policies, it is essential for them to be aware of the potential outcomes of leaving. His willingness to raise such questions was forthright, and the country deserves to have these issues thoroughly debated.

The phrase “Project Fear” has frequently appeared during the discussions. Our aim is to prevail through reasoned arguments, with people making decisions based on the merits and rationale of each side, rather than due to confusion or tactics intended to instill fear. I am concerned that the debate could deteriorate into a style reminiscent of an American presidential election, where negativity tends to dominate over positive and well-informed perspectives.

My hon. Friend also brought up several detailed points, which I intend to address in due course.",Conflict
"Does the Prime Minister now acknowledge that his efforts to pressure European leaders into accepting his defective reforms have been unsuccessful and that he has returned with very little to show for it? Is he genuinely taken aback by this outcome, considering he has not collaborated effectively with his European counterparts and did not attend when requested to assist with the European refugee crisis? Achieving change requires patient and skillful diplomacy, as well as building alliances. [Interruption.] Certainly, we all appreciate our allies. However, the Prime Minister appears more focused on his party’s interests than on fostering such relationships. He is engaging in political manoeuvring instead of prioritising the interests of the nation.

Can the Prime Minister clarify whether his Government will take a position on the choice presented to the public in the forthcoming referendum, and explain the process by which this position will be determined and communicated? What response has he offered to Lord Heseltine’s comment that Britain would become “a laughing stock across the world” if the Prime Minister proceeded with the announcement made today? European leaders perceive the Prime Minister’s demands as a bluff, a political tactic to serve Conservative party interests. Does the Prime Minister concede that this bluff has now been exposed?",Conflict
"What has been particularly disappointing is the collaboration between Members of the Labour Front Bench and the Government. The Government had no intention of allowing a debate on these significant issues, for reasons I understand and respect. However, it is regrettable that the Labour party has acted contrary to its historical principles. This situation reflects a mix of inefficiency within its Front Bench and considerable internal disagreement, with a few notable exceptions, including the right hon. Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn). These Members have abandoned the party's traditional support for the free movement of people and have not effectively advocated for a positive immigration stance.

The referendum result revealed a deeply divided nation, a division that is particularly evident within the Labour party. Labour Members have been hesitant, seemingly immobilised by the knowledge that their local party organisations have been influenced by the far left, and, in many cases, that as many as 70% of their own supporters voted to leave.",Conflict
"This brings us to the concept that “no deal is preferable to a bad deal.” The Prime Minister has demonstrated difficulty in securing an agreement even with her “friends and allies” in the DUP—moreover, she initially appeared unaware of this. On 10 June, there was a statement declaring, “We have reached a deal with the DUP.” Subsequently, it was clarified that “there is no deal with the DUP.” The Queen’s Speech was postponed by two days to allow time for the agreement to be finalized, yet to date, no deal with the DUP has been reached. Given these circumstances, it raises questions about the Prime Minister’s ability to lead a minority Government and successfully negotiate a more favourable arrangement with the remaining 27 EU member states. The situation seems inconsistent.",Conflict
"Let me move on to the main issue at hand, as I have already spoken longer than I intended. As I mentioned earlier, any proposal for Parliament to grant complete authority to any Government to manage these matters would have been met with strong opposition, rather than the typical applause and jeers directed at any Minister who dared to suggest it. It has been argued—the hon. Member for Bassetlaw (John Mann) finds this convincing, although I do not—that the next claim we will encounter is that the House of Commons should assume responsibility for the negotiations. Naturally, we do not support that idea. I fully agree that it is an unreasonable suggestion.",Conflict
"I am concerned that this Bill may serve as a diversion from the primary objective of doing everything possible to secure an improved protocol agreement for Northern Ireland. Additionally, I worry that it could give Unionists the false impression that a simple, clear-cut solution exists, whereas in reality, after this Bill undergoes consideration in the House of Lords and the courts, and following any responses or retaliations from the EU, a compromise will eventually be necessary. Our main priority should be on encouraging the EU to enter into negotiations to achieve the required modifications for Northern Ireland, including support from the right hon. Member’s party.

There is a risk that this approach could further complicate discussions with the EU and member states and extend the period of uncertainty for Northern Ireland businesses. It could also expose the entire UK to potential trade and tariff countermeasures. Moreover, this may deepen the belief among many moderate voters in Northern Ireland that the aim of concluding Brexit by abolishing the protocol does not align with their interests. It is important to consider this aspect of gaining public support as we work to persuade and encourage people to remain committed to the Union.",Conflict
"Secondly, I wish to address a matter of a more local nature. While the rest of the country will need to wait for a national in/out referendum, north Northamptonshire is already conducting its own in/out referendum. This initiative is being led in Kettering by my honourable Friend, the Member for Kettering (Mr Hollobone), in my own constituency by myself, and in the Corby constituency by Thomas Pursglove, the Conservative candidate, who, I am pleased to inform the Prime Minister, shares a Eurosceptic stance similar to mine and that of my honourable Friend for Kettering. We are in the process of distributing 250,000 ballot papers containing the straightforward question of whether the residents of north Northamptonshire wish to remain in or leave the EU. The referendum will conclude by the end of the year, and the results will be submitted to Downing Street. At this point, I believe it is accurate to state that approximately 85% of the returned ballots indicate a preference to leave the EU.",Conflict
"I am pleased to report that Brexit has been successful. This was evident, in particular, during the vaccine distribution; had we followed the Opposition’s approach, the pace of vaccinations and the reopening process would have been slower. We have restored our autonomy, allowing us to make independent decisions. However, the SNP’s position is somewhat contradictory, as they seek independence only to transfer authority to the European Union and accept directives from Brussels. If SNP Members choose to pursue this stance in their campaigns, it seems unlikely they will achieve their goals. Regarding the issue raised by the hon. Gentleman, it is currently progressing through both the House of Lords and the House of Commons, and I am confident it will be established at an appropriate time.",Conflict

I do not believe we should shy away from this on matters such as climate change—which is indeed occurring—as well as security policies, among others. At the same time, let us also consider where less European involvement might be preferable. The topic of fisheries has been raised; it is important to remember that it was not the European Union but the United Kingdom Government, which claimed to represent Scotland’s fishermen, that referred to them as expendable. On that note, I will conclude. Thank you, Mr Speaker.",Conflict
"The hon. Lady may express disagreement, but the policy is fundamentally established in the context of the UK having left the EU. This concerns an immigration framework governed by a British Government, no longer subject to EU legislation, policies, or alignment. This represents a significant and foundational change. The system is designed to restore control, as stated by the British Government, over our borders and to ensure that the most skilled individuals can enter through a tiered, points-based system, as detailed in the policy document.

This approach will reduce dependence on low-skilled labour, and the hon. Lady should join the Government in supporting the shared goal of ensuring higher wages for workers. The aim is to develop a high-skilled economy rather than one based on low pay. Regarding social care, it should not be seen as primarily low-skilled work. Those employed in social care deserve fair compensation, and it is appropriate for businesses and employers to invest in the development of skills necessary to deliver compassionate care.

It appears that the Labour party has not taken into account the views expressed by the British public in the general election and the 2016 referendum and continues to support policies favouring open borders and unrestricted immigration.",Conflict
"Mr Speaker, as you will remember, this House has engaged in numerous debates and statements—there is no question about that—but Parliament has not been fully engaged in efforts to forge a compromise or identify a solution for delivering Brexit. Such involvement should have occurred at the outset of the process, yet, somewhat ironically, it is happening only now. Regrettably, my right hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke (Mrs Miller) and my hon. Friend the Member for Wells (James Heappey) are not present to respond, but for them to discuss compromise at this advanced stage—perhaps unaware or not fully appreciating the developments of the past two and a half years—was, at best, unfortunate.

I say this without satisfaction, but the responsibility rests clearly with the leadership—or the absence thereof—at the highest levels of Government, within the Cabinet, and within my party. On numerous occasions and in various meetings, Members of this House who supported remain approached the Prime Minister and engaged in detailed discussions about how to implement the referendum result while maintaining unity in this House, building consensus, and addressing those who were unlikely to be appeased or satisfied and who insisted on a hard Brexit.",Conflict

Friend’s detailed knowledge is so extensive that it is understandable why Baroness Hale mistakenly identified him as the Chief Whip; he clearly has a thorough command of the topic, making that an entirely reasonable error. He is, of course, absolutely correct, and there is a significant point here: those who do not support the programme motion will essentially be voting against Brexit occurring on 31 October. It is important that this is clearly understood, and it will not be possible to convince one group that they supported Second Reading and were therefore in favour, while telling another that they opposed the timetable and were against Brexit; such a distinction will not hold.",Conflict

I note the somewhat differing perspectives of the hon. Gentleman and the hon. Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Angus Brendan MacNeil). I wish for us to keep refining our policy. I have consistently acknowledged that the single market issue is complex due to free movement, but where we can identify shared positions with certain Conservative Members, we should seek to strengthen that consensus and collective resolve. Ultimately, if the Government find themselves unable to secure approval for their policies in the House of Commons, they will need to reconsider their stance. As I stated in my previous speech in the House, should the Government fail to fulfil their responsibilities, the House will need to take action on their behalf.",Conflict

He mentioned, “You know, I have never previously voted against a provision of this nature. I have never cast a vote that I believed to be contrary to the interests of what I regard as the European Union and its aims.” I acknowledge that, as he has maintained consistent positions, and I hold that in regard. Nonetheless, the fact remains that he did cast his vote in favour of that Bill at Third Reading, as did every other Conservative Member.",Conflict

The Labour party has now been compelled to submit the motion to the House—a motion that ideally should have been discussed before Christmas. I acknowledge the debate taking place today, and based on its outcome, I urge our colleagues in the Labour party to collaborate with us in holding this Government accountable. To achieve this, we must acknowledge the negative impact that Brexit will have on all our constituents.

Last night, I attended a Delegated Legislation Committee that examined a technical document on railway safety. In that context, the Government allowed a two-year transition period. As I mentioned during the Committee, we have a two-year timeframe for transitioning railway safety, yet this group appears to believe that a free trade agreement and future arrangements can be finalized within a matter of months. This situation seems quite unreasonable.",Conflict

Northern Ireland will continue to follow the EU single market regulations for goods and agricultural products, whereas the remainder of the UK will not. As highlighted by the right hon.

The Prime Minister previously stated at a DUP conference that such a border would never be established—a statement made relatively recently, possibly during his campaign to become leader of the Conservative Party.

On Saturday, the Prime Minister informed the House that there would be no checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. However, yesterday the Brexit Secretary told the Lords European Union Committee that businesses in Northern Ireland sending goods to Great Britain would be required to complete export declaration forms. Is the Prime Minister’s statement accurate, or is the Brexit Secretary’s? Both statements cannot be correct.",Conflict

Nonetheless, we have gained some insight into the types of guerrilla strategies expected to be employed in this Parliament, including chanting responses aligned with his statements.

However, he does not have the authority to dismiss the perspectives of over one million individuals in Scotland who supported Brexit, whose views the SNP appears to overlook. Additionally, he cannot disregard the outcome of the referendum across the entire United Kingdom. Consequently, it is the responsibility of this Government to implement Brexit, and that is our commitment.

I trust the right hon. Gentleman was not deliberately misconstruing the Sewel convention, as it is not an absolute principle. He presented it as if it were, but that is incorrect. As I mentioned in my statement, the Government will seek consent except in cases where usual conditions do not apply, and it is widely acknowledged that the UK’s departure from the EU constitutes exceptional circumstances.",Conflict

There are 203 nights until Christmas, which many will naturally look forward to, but there are also 140 days remaining before we are scheduled to exit the European Union without an agreement, a scenario that businesses certainly oppose and for which there is no majority either in this Chamber or across the country. Regrettably, Labour Front Benchers were unable yesterday to secure sufficient support from their own MPs to initiate measures to prevent a no-deal exit from the EU. The Leader of the House, who is well-regarded and always strives to do his best, has stated that the Government's position is that Parliament should not be prorogued by whichever individual becomes Prime Minister next, thereby excluding Parliament and causing a no-deal departure. The Government apparently consider that action to be inappropriate for any future Prime Minister. What steps will he take to guarantee that Parliament assumes control over the process, and that we do not leave without a deal at the end of October due to the actions of a reckless Prime Minister?",Conflict
"I acknowledge the point raised by the hon. Gentleman. He suggests that I advocate for independence, and indeed I do support that position. However, Members of the Government should recognize that a significant portion of Scotland’s population feels deeply dissatisfied with this process. They are upset by the lack of respect shown to Scotland since the EU referendum, during which Scotland voted decisively against Brexit but was told to remain silent and accept the outcome. Following the 2014 referendum, Scotland was described as a partner of equal standing, yet shortly afterward, it was made clear that Scotland is part of the United Kingdom rather than an equal partner. This Bill confirms that perception for many people in Scotland.

I won the Stirling constituency from the Conservatives with 51% of the vote precisely because I support the rule of law and international cooperation, as exemplified by the multilateral, binding, and voluntary solidarity within the European Union. This is a framework with which we are comfortable, and one within which Scotland is well suited to exist going forward. It could be said that Scotland currently possesses a more defined understanding of its role in the world than the UK as a whole.",Conflict
"It is therefore regrettable that the official Opposition was unable to present a single Back Bencher to speak in support of devolution today. While they have only one hon. Member representing Scotland, they have previously called on MPs from other parts of the United Kingdom to comment on Scottish issues. Their absence today is not unexpected, however, especially considering that their peers in the House of Lords refrained from acting yesterday on amendments intended to maintain state aid as a devolved responsibility, as well as Lord Thomas’s amendment opposing the Government’s provisions on direct spending in devolved areas. This occurs in clear contravention of the commitment made by the former Labour party leader. Despite this, Labour has shown little interest. They readily deploy Gordon Brown to discuss federalism when the topic of independence is prominent, yet they are absent when it comes to supporting the current devolved arrangement. This situation is unfortunate, leaving it to the SNP to uphold the cause of devolution. Although this effort may be unsuccessful, it will likely strengthen the argument in favor of independence.",Conflict

Similarly, Russia is maintaining its stance through ongoing destabilisation of Ukraine and the unlawful occupation of Crimea. Tensions are escalating in the South China Sea. The migration crisis in the eastern and central Mediterranean is creating new difficulties for our neighbouring countries in Europe.

"During my life, the outcome of general elections in Scotland has not influenced the overall result across the United Kingdom. The selection of the Prime Minister has consistently been determined by voters in England and Wales. Prior to 2015, the party holding the majority of Scottish seats in Westminster was, for various reasons, committed to the idea of eventually participating in a UK Government. Despite a significant democratic shortfall that prompted the establishment of Scotland’s devolved Parliament, it was generally accepted that the Scottish majority would adhere to the UK-wide result. However, since 2015, the majority of Scottish MPs elected here have adopted a different stance. They argue that if the UK is unable or unwilling to address the priorities of their constituents, there must be an option to pursue a different direction.

There are no Liberal Democrat members present at the moment, but they raised concerns earlier about proportional representation. It should be noted that they were in coalition with this group for five years and did not fulfill that commitment, so their objections now, when the electoral system disadvantages them, lack foundation—",Conflict

Currently, more than 110 full-time staff members, including recent hires, are engaged in planning for both deal and no-deal scenarios.

"Those of us who put forward Labour’s motion have been accused of being remoaners employing parliamentary procedures to delay the UK's exit from the EU. Although the Government has now agreed to our motion, we face criticism for requesting too much information or for potentially jeopardising their chances of achieving the best possible result. It has been stated that no ongoing commentary will be provided. In her characteristically clear speech, my hon.

She addressed issues that may be difficult for some, yet they require answers, and I commend her for doing so.",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to the Leader of the House for outlining the agenda for the upcoming week, and I fully endorse her remarks regarding Holocaust Memorial Day.

Tomorrow is, of course, Burns Night, Mr Speaker, and we are aware of your fondness for haggis. We should recall the memorable Selkirk Grace you recited at an SNP Burns supper a few years ago. Burns captured the essence of Brexit with these lines:

“The best-laid schemes o’ mice an’ men

Gang aft a-gley,

An’ lea’e us nought but grief an’ pain,

For promis’d joy!”

For colleagues unfamiliar with 18th century Scots, “aft a-gley” translates as “gone awry,” and nothing better encapsulates this damaging, isolating, and unfortunate situation than Burns’ insightful words.

On Tuesday, we will consider the amendments related to Brexit. The responsibility for selecting the amendments rests solely with you, Mr Speaker, but I anticipate the Leader of the House will wish to confirm that the Government’s primary aim will be to respect the will of the House on that day: no procedural maneuvers, no efforts to oppose the House’s decision, and the only outcome will be the Government facing defeat once more.",Conflict
"Earlier today, the Work and Pensions Committee together with the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee released a detailed report regarding the failure of Carillion. Under typical conditions, this would have received significant attention. However, due to a multitude of other Government setbacks, reversals, and internal disputes, it has not yet gained widespread notice. Upon the report’s release, the Chair of the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, the hon. Member for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves), stated:

“The company’s delusional directors drove Carillion off a cliff and then tried to blame everyone but themselves.”

It may be noted that this comment could well be frequently referenced in the future to characterize the Cabinet’s approach to Brexit.

The Cabinet has not met its duty to present credible plans to prevent the situation the Prime Minister referred to as a cliff edge. It may be appropriate for this Parliament to respond to the Cabinet in the same manner the Cabinet would address an underperforming local authority or health body: by assuming control and placing the Cabinet under special oversight.",Conflict
"It is evident that, unless the UK Government reverses its current stance, electrification will extend only up to Cardiff. The European Commission considers the extension of electrification to Swansea to be significant for rail and transport connections across Europe; however, the UK Government apparently does not share this view.

While the EU demonstrates commitment to cross-European collaboration and investment, UK policy in recent years has increasingly focused on supporting one area of the British state based in London.",Conflict

"Should this agreement be rejected, it would be prudent to cease revisiting the same issue repeatedly. We acknowledge the efforts of Monsieur Juncker and Monsieur Barnier in issuing various comfort letters; however, it is understood that these documents lack legal enforceability. Rather than receiving another nominal assurance from Brussels, it is hoped that the Government will return to this Chamber with a strategy aligned with the Prime Minister’s initial approach. This would involve adhering to the principles set out at Lancaster House, retaining the reasonable components of the withdrawal agreement, removing the backstop, agreeing to a transition period during which a zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade agreement can be negotiated, withholding at least half of the £39 billion until such an agreement is secured, affirming the clear consensus that there is no plan, intention, or requirement for a hard border in Northern Ireland, and proceeding promptly and vigorously with preparations for a no-deal scenario.

Despite any bureaucratic, technical, or logistical challenges, as highlighted by Monsieur Puissesseau of the Calais-Boulogne ports, these obstacles are surmountable through optimism and resolve. Such an approach should now be adopted in relation to Brexit.",Conflict
"May I extend my best wishes for a happy new year to you, Mr Speaker, as well as to all Members and staff?

It is disappointing that, following the Christmas recess, there has been no advancement from the Government regarding the withdrawal agreement. Even more notably, the Prime Minister is absent from Parliament. She has chosen not to attend. With only a few days remaining before the deadline to secure a deal that safeguards our economy, the Prime Minister is not present to account for the lack of progress. Can the Prime Minister explain why she is not addressing this pressing issue?

It has become evident that the Prime Minister’s strategy is to delay proceedings, limiting Parliament’s options beyond her Brexit plan, thereby increasing the likelihood of a no-deal outcome. The SNP intends to collaborate across the House to build support for an alternative approach, which involves holding another EU referendum and allowing the public to reclaim control from the Government. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to take a clear position and join us in opposing this Government’s disorganized Brexit strategy.",Conflict

"The timing is also incorrect, as those of us supporting continued EU membership wish to utilize every chance to present a constructive argument for it. The UK Government is unable to present a cohesive argument for membership because the Conservative party and Cabinet are significantly split on this important matter, so a well-informed discussion and adequate time for it are necessary. It would be inappropriate for the Prime Minister to devote extensive time and effort to private discussions with the Heads of State of each EU country without properly considering the perspectives of the various Governments throughout these islands.",Conflict
"During my previous address to the House on 25 September—the right hon. Gentleman alluded to my statement at that time—I extended an invitation to any Member of Parliament to visit the Cabinet Office and the Department for Exiting the European Union to discuss both a potential deal and preparations for a no-deal scenario. Only two Opposition MPs responded to this invitation: the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) and the hon. Member for North Down (Lady Hermon). This response reflects the level of engagement from the Labour party, the SNP, and other Opposition parties regarding our Brexit negotiations: an open invitation to engage was declined.

Is this unexpected? In 2017, the right hon. Gentleman expressed the following about the referendum:

“We’ve had a decision and we respect that decision.”

He also stated that the Labour party should not spend all its efforts attempting to “rub out yesterday” and must accept a result it is duty-bound to respect. As I noted earlier, after voting against the deal on three occasions, he declined the chance to collaborate across the Front Benches to achieve agreement on a deal.",Conflict
"The Leader of the House has indicated that we ought to appreciate the Prime Minister’s willingness to make a challenging decision. I assume this means appreciating the Prime Minister’s commitment to that decision, especially considering the reversals witnessed in recent days. Such is the nature of the role—facing difficult choices. There are significant issues requiring decisions, including the situation in Ukraine, the fact that President Putin possesses nuclear weapons, the disruptions following Brexit, gang-related crime, the climate emergency, and the Ebola outbreak in Africa. Currently, unless the Leader of the House provides different information, it appears that the Prime Minister is avoiding confronting these matters directly. Should it not be time for her to step aside and allow another individual capable of making decisions in the national interest to assume responsibility?",Conflict
"I have observed the ongoing contest between the two parties across the Chamber regarding who constitutes the genuine Opposition. I anticipate that this dispute will persist for quite some time. Meanwhile, I would remind the House that we will continue to govern the country and act in the best interests of our constituents.

The hon. Member referred to the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s speech at Mansion House last evening and mentioned austerity. I believe there is a misunderstanding of a straightforward principle: it is sensible for individuals to live within their means. That is the position we uphold. It is the opposing party that advocates for imprudence, which contributed to the difficulties this country has faced. It is appropriate that we adopt a responsible approach going forward. It is regrettable that Scottish nationalists fail to appreciate this.

Regarding the European Union Referendum Bill, I have reviewed the amendments submitted by SNP Members. These will be debated next week, and we will observe whether the House endorses them.",Conflict
"Prior to delving into the complexities of referendums and the various arguments surrounding Brexit, it is worth acknowledging that European impact on the English language has a long history, evident in terms such as Spanish omelettes, German measles, Dutch auctions, and, more provocatively, French letters and French kissing—appropriate examples given the topic of European matters.

What was once considered a distant continent across the channel with only limited significance is now frequently portrayed by some as a threatening entity to be feared and criticised. It is unfortunate that the term “Europe” often evokes a range of associations. Critics tend to emphasize concerns, particularly regarding migration, which often serves as a stand-in for other issues; however, the subject encompasses many other aspects beyond this.",Conflict
"On 14 January, the Prime Minister confirmed to the House that the entitlement to identify as British, Irish, or both in Northern Ireland is explicit and included within the withdrawal agreement. However, during remarks made in Belfast on 5 February, the Prime Minister acknowledged that

“I know that in some cases recently, people have encountered difficulties in securing their”—

Irish—

“rights as Irish citizens”.

In light of this, does the Prime Minister acknowledge and concur that Emma DeSouza, along with many others in Northern Ireland, hold Irish citizenship and are consequently citizens of the EU, despite the Home Office’s position that they are British citizens?",Conflict
"We have received several noteworthy contributions today, with significant points presented from both sides of the House, and I will endeavour to address as many as possible within the time remaining. As has been noted by numerous Members, this Budget can unfortunately be characterised as complacent, a criticism voiced not only by the Opposition during this discussion. This sense of complacency was perhaps most evident in the Chancellor’s evaluation of the economic state of the country, and I was taken aback to hear the same view reiterated by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Typically meticulous, he appeared to imply this afternoon that the Government’s forecasts might be increased if a favourable agreement were reached with the EU. Yet, those forecasts already assume that a deal consistent with the Prime Minister’s position will be secured with the EU, a premise that is clearly being questioned by a number of Conservative Back Benchers. Such confidence is profoundly imprudent.",Conflict
"I tell my hon. Friend that the proposal for a comprehensive customs union has been put forward repeatedly over many months. It has not been adequately examined due to the Prime Minister’s stance; this is not the fault of the Opposition. To be clear: we will not place the future of the country at risk based on the result of a Conservative party leadership election, over which most Members have no influence and can only observe.

In the absence of the necessary clarity and safeguards within the political declaration, approval of this withdrawal agreement should not proceed. The vote today represents a superficial tactic by a Government attempting to avoid confronting the fact that a substantive vote on both the political declaration and the withdrawal agreement must be returned to the House. Over many months, the Prime Minister’s agreement has led to division and disagreement, precisely when unity on the way forward was required. The national interest lies in fostering agreement on a future that safeguards the employment and well-being of all constituents. For these reasons, the House ought to reject this motion.",Conflict
"The Scottish National Party holds the position that it is neither feasible nor realistic to complete the negotiations and implement their outcomes within the shortened schedule that has been established. Additionally, given the context of an unprecedented global pandemic and a severe economic downturn, potentially the worst in three centuries, it is considered unwise to expect that the process can be properly carried out within such a limited period.

This perspective is shared by many observers who have had the opportunity to monitor and analyze the British Government’s handling of the negotiations, including the poorly timed and somewhat petulant letter sent by Mr Frost to Mr Barnier last month. This action is widely regarded as representing a low point in the Government’s approach to the negotiations.",Conflict
"The Prime Minister attended the European Council with the aim of obtaining legal guarantees but did not secure any, and the upcoming Council meeting is set for the third week of March. Given that Cabinet Ministers are now openly discussing potential actions if her deal is rejected, can she explain to the House what is achieved by maintaining the pretense that a no-deal exit from the European Union is a possibility, when she is fully aware of how harmful and catastrophic that outcome would be, especially considering her recent statement to the House highlighting the risks it poses to the “jobs, services and security” of the population?",Conflict
"On this basis, I have stated that this agreement represents the least favourable outcome, ultimately failing to satisfy any party. It is likely the most undesirable result achievable, leaving all sides dissatisfied. Whether one agrees with my position or that of my right hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel), for instance, both options have advantages and disadvantages, yet each offers a distinct and viable plan for the nation.

My concern is that this House has reached an impasse. As demonstrated by this debate, significant divisions remain in opinion, which is understandable. In my view, due to this deadlock, the British public should now be given the final decision on the clear choices presented by Brexit. It is essential to resolve this matter promptly to enable progress on critical issues facing the country, including housing, social mobility, and social care. That should be our objective. I do not support a compromise that would require reopening and renegotiation at a later date. I have formed my position on the Chequers proposal, and I anticipate that colleagues will examine it further in the days ahead. I leave Members to consider these remarks:",Conflict
"Regarding the issue of a second referendum—[Interruption.] Which outcome is more detrimental? I have addressed this question multiple times. The decision the hon. Lady offers me effectively boils down to a choice between no deal and no Brexit, with a second referendum serving as a stand-in for the latter. As the right hon. Member for Don Valley (Caroline Flint) has noted, a second vote essentially equates to a stop Brexit referendum. If a Member from the shadow Minister’s own side can acknowledge this truthfully, she ought to be equally straightforward. Responding to her query, of the two possibilities, I consider no Brexit to be more problematic than no deal. While no deal would cause disruption, a point I have openly conveyed to colleagues within my party, the shadow Minister has persistently opposed any deal, and it is precisely such a deal that would have protected the interests of sectors like the chemicals industry.",Conflict

I invite the Labour party, as they make remarks from the Front Bench, to state whether they oppose securing the supply of medicines to the UK in the event of a no-deal Brexit.",Conflict
"There comes a time when we must acknowledge the necessity of completing these negotiations, and the most effective approach is to present a united front to Europe.

"Once again, the Government has introduced a questionable financial incentive, seemingly aimed at diverting attention from their struggling Brexit strategy.

To begin, I would like to inquire of the Secretary of State whether this funding will be subject to the Barnett formula for Scotland, and when the funds are expected to be allocated. Mr Speaker, I seek clarification on the Barnettisation because every city deal to date has resulted in Scotland receiving less, with the Scottish Government consistently contributing more than the UK Government.

While I have no objection to investment in any town, this announcement represents a minor addition amid broader austerity measures. The £1.6 billion declared today is minimal compared to the funding that would have been provided by the EU. According to the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, the UK would have been entitled to €13 billion over the same timeframe. The £33 million allocated solely to the south-west region is comparatively small.",Conflict
"I fully concur. My hon. Friend raises an additional observation regarding the Government’s ongoing challenges in comprehending and effectively supporting the international sector. This is why it is particularly disappointing that the Minister is unwilling—or indeed unable—to advance further on this matter. He and his colleagues have been constrained by directives from No. 10 and the Home Office. This is the situation as it stands. The Conservative party and its members remain divided on this topic. The hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh), who is stepping down, aptly highlighted this disarray in The Times today. Such confusion is something that Labour, when in government, would not have tolerated.

Throughout this election period, we will persist in advocating for the exclusion of students from net migration figures for public policy considerations. While I genuinely acknowledge the introduction of the new designated body mentioned by the Minister, the reality, as pointed out by the hon. Member for Bedford, is that this arrangement leaves the Minister without a clear mechanism of support to achieve the goal that he likely hopes to realise through this process.",Conflict

Will the Prime Minister now take the opportunity to listen?",Conflict

The tone now appears less civil and markedly different from that of 1975.",Conflict
"There is a risk that the referendum campaign will feature a yes camp comprising individuals who desire a position that is partially in and partially out, while the no camp will also be unclear, containing both those who advocate for complete withdrawal and others who argue that rejecting the proposal would allow for a partial exit with opportunities to renegotiate, similar to the approach taken by Ireland. The concern is that the referendum may fail to resolve the issue definitively in the manner that Members anticipate.",Conflict
"As do many prudent lawmakers, I rely on independent specialists for insights and responses concerning intricate issues like the natural environment. Since other Members have effectively addressed my observations on the circular economy, I will proceed to my subsequent point.

“What effect do you anticipate the UK’s departure from the EU will have on environmental protection?”

Fundamentally, his argument regarding Brexit, nationalism, and Northern Ireland’s future seems to suggest that Brexit should be disregarded altogether. That appears to be the implication of his position. What I am keen to understand from him is this: what elements are novel in relation to the Prime Minister’s commitments? That is the information we are awaiting.",Conflict
"Our objective is to secure additional time to reach a consensus and ensure a successful Brexit. I am optimistic that this amendment will pass this evening; however, if it does not, it will be due to the Prime Minister’s commitment at the Dispatch Box to return to the House on 14 February with a motion similar in nature to this one and open to amendment. My honourable colleagues and I, representing various parts of the House, will propose a comparable amendment along with a corresponding Bill, and I trust that Members will lend them their support.",Conflict
"The subject of today’s discussion concerns the United Kingdom’s role on the global stage, a role that has arguably been reduced more than usual under the current Government. This reduction is not attributable to the UK population or those who supported leaving the EU, but rather to the ongoing inability of those who promoted a misleading narrative about Brexit and lack the expertise to implement it effectively. The country’s standing has even declined in the eyes of those whom Brexit supporters consider potential allies beyond Europe. For instance, former Australian Prime Minister Gillard has remarked:

“I do worry that people are starting to imagine that a trade deal with Australia is somehow a substitute for being on the doorstep of a market with 500 million people—it’s not.”

Her observation is accurate. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the Canadian newspaper, The Globe and Mail, recently issued an apology after, six months prior, it had labelled the Government’s Brexit approach as a complete “omnishambles,” stating that the situation could not deteriorate further—yet it did. At least, the publication acknowledged and apologized for its previous misjudgment.",Conflict

Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) has recently adopted the role of a witchfinder pursuivant: “I observed Goody Braverman speaking with the ERG in the Aye Lobby—she must be condemned!” This situation does not resemble a revival of the Blair era. We are not confronted with bright, intelligent individuals presenting alternatives to the nation; instead, it is merely continual fault-finding. They represent a weary and indolent Opposition. I considered describing them as beige but concluded they are more akin to a Farrow and Ball selection. Reviewing the palette, the shade closest to beige was named smoked trout, which seems quite fitting.",Conflict

In the previous week, the House decided by a substantial majority to exclude any chance of the UK exiting the EU without an agreement. Should the Government, through delay or other reasons, allow a no-deal exit to occur, it would represent, without doubt, the most significant instance of Parliament being disregarded in the history of this and any other Parliament. The Government now have 11 days remaining to undertake the necessary measures to avert this outcome. When the no-deal option was rejected last Tuesday, there were 17 days left, indicating that the Government have spent over one-third of that period without any action. The Minister provided numerous assurances about their intended plans but was unable to specify what steps have been taken to obtain and secure an extension.",Conflict

"The Government has found itself in a predicament of its own making, as clearly expressed by the hon. Member for Harwich and North Essex (Sir Bernard Jenkin). Over the course of three years, the Government encountered significant difficulty in securing approval for their withdrawal agreement in this House. They devoted so much time to it that it is unlikely there was any detail of the agreement unfamiliar to them. In January, they entered into a legally binding international treaty. The Prime Minister endorsed it and referred to it at the time as a “negotiating triumph.” Beyond being a triumph in negotiation, he assured the public in December that it was “oven-ready” and ready for implementation. He promised voters, “Vote for me and I will get Brexit done,” and, for reasons that remain unclear to me, the electorate supported him. Consequently, in December, with a substantial majority, he led all Conservative MPs through the Lobby to back his deal. Yet now, the Government seeks to unilaterally alter the terms and withdraw from commitments made earlier this year. By doing so, they are willing to breach international law, further damage the UK’s already weakened reputation, and undermine the devolution arrangements. This represents a notable development, even by this Government’s standards.",Conflict

Amendment (a) to new clause 5 would explicitly permit the implementation of the Lugano convention through new clause 5. Comparable amendments have been submitted by the Chair of the Justice Committee and the Scottish National Party. Each of these amendments would enable the Government to pursue their declared objective of enacting the Lugano convention without conferring broad Henry VIII powers or the capacity to bypass Parliament. I remark to the Under-Secretary of State for Justice, the hon. Member for Cheltenham (Alex Chalk), that he does not resemble Henry VIII; nor, as far as I remember from historical accounts, does he exhibit Henry VIII’s demeanor. Therefore, why is there a need for these powers, which I anticipate he may argue are essential?",Conflict
"With a Prime Minister who has a background in public relations, this Government frequently issues press statements but lacks the capability to follow through on them. Therefore, it is necessary to have a debate during Government time focused on Government inefficiency. Now in their fourth year of office, they have constructed only one of the 261 new schools promised in their “priority” building initiative; only seven out of 576 infrastructure projects pledged have been completed; and only 2,000 out of the 100,000 new homes promised under the NewBuy scheme have been delivered. They committed to establishing a British investment bank to support business growth, yet no businesses have received assistance to date. They introduced the Youth Contract to facilitate employment for young people, but it remains unused. They allocated £530 million to local councils for superfast broadband, but have only disbursed £3 million so far. Although they claim to support increased infrastructure expenditure, a £1 billion reduction in capital spending was announced yesterday. They pledged to reduce borrowing, but it is currently £245 billion above their forecast. Is it not accurate to say they are engaging in posturing rather than effective governance? They are focusing on spin instead of delivery. This issue extends beyond the Chancellor’s Byron burger event being a façade—it reflects the entire Government.",Conflict

Although it cannot be done through primary legislation—if it could, we would—it is assured that if Labour is in government, the statutory instrument addressing this issue will be debated on the Floor of both Houses rather than in a Committee. This will guarantee that all Members have the chance to speak if called upon and that they will all have the right to vote on the matter.”––[Official Report, Higher Education Public Bill Committee, 26 February 2004; c. 323.]

This morning, I consulted the definition of a coup, which is described as the sudden seizure of leadership or power and its substitution by different elites within the state structure. At present, a clear division exists on the Opposition Benches between the two factions of the Labour party—we can observe this separation.

The critical nature of the current situation and the unsatisfactory state of affairs rest with the Government, rather than those employed within the security sector. The UK significantly contributes to European security efforts. For instance, through the Schengen Information System (SIS II), the UK shares real-time information on wanted individuals, missing persons, and suspected terrorists, which benefits all parties involved. UK police access data from this system millions of times annually, which should underscore to all Members the considerable risks posed by the absence of a long-term security arrangement.",Conflict
"Several of us directly urged the Prime Minister to look beyond the Labour Front Bench, which has been ineffective in its role as Her Majesty’s Opposition, and to build a consensus that clearly existed not only among Labour Back Benchers but also with the SNP, whose Members have consistently expressed support for remaining in the single market and customs union. We attempted to initiate this approach early on; however, similar to the 48% remainers, we were disregarded, and the Prime Minister made the significant error of focusing on appeasing the ERG members, who now function as a faction within the Conservative Party.

I will not repeat the thoughtful remarks made by my colleague, the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden), but to add to the difficulties, instead of transparency and honesty, we were presented with vague and unhelpful slogans such as “Brexit means Brexit,” the meaning of which was unclear to many. Most concerning was the assertion that no deal would be preferable to a bad deal, and now there is surprise that efforts are underway to convince people that no deal would be the worst possible outcome. Only at the last possible moment, having explored all other options, did we settle on the proposal of a people’s vote, which currently stands as the sole viable solution to resolve the ongoing situation.",Conflict
"There are two main factors explaining why a deal has not been reached. Firstly, Members of this House have not supported a deal through their votes. Had they examined the matter carefully two years ago, they likely would have readily accepted all the terms contained within the withdrawal agreement and the transition period, which will now be overseen by a Brexiteer. Secondly, a considerable number of people in the UK have not recognised that it is the United Kingdom that is departing from the EU. This means the negotiation is between the UK and the EU. There has been a lack of genuine understanding of the EU and its positions, with a misconception that the process was merely a list of demands from the UK, rather than a negotiation. Additionally, the language employed—developed over more than two decades of persistent negative commentary about the EU—has contributed to the failure to secure a deal.",Conflict
"Allow me to recap the key points made in contributions that addressed this matter most effectively. My right hon. Friend the Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott), the shadow Home Secretary, clearly illustrated that this agreement puts at risk all the collaboration with the European Union that we depend on in areas such as justice, security, and policing, and as a result, it is unacceptable. My hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North (Stephen Pound) highlighted, in his characteristically engaging speech, that the problems concerning the Northern Ireland border remain completely unresolved. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) emphasised an important point—one that I believe many Conservative Members share—that the current deal does not provide control over our laws, borders, or finances. Rather, it relinquishes control to Europe without granting us influence over these matters.",Conflict
"Although it is a new year, the situation appears to be a repetitive one, with the same approach as before: attempting to compel Parliament to choose between an undesirable deal for the UK and no deal at all, while emphasizing the supposedly worse outcomes of no deal. In response to the question posed by my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), will the Secretary of State today provide details on the expenditure incurred for the exercise involving 100 lorries circulating around Kent? Additionally, what is his assessment of the impact of that exercise on the UK’s international standing? Does he believe that any other nation would view that exercise as a positive example to emulate in relation to Brexit?",Conflict
"Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am pleased to contribute to this, my initial debate of the new decade, with you presiding, on the significant topic of Britain’s role internationally. In an era where global political developments appear to present numerous concerns, and as we exit the European Union, I was genuinely disheartened that the Queen’s Speech failed to acknowledge the opportunities and challenges faced by my constituency, my region, and the nation as a whole, especially considering that the agreement governing our departure from the European Union is among the least favorable.",Conflict
"The remarks made by the right hon. Gentleman were quite revealing. On the Conservative side, we do value employment highly. Supporting people to be in work is fundamentally the most crucial action we can take to help address the cost of living. Therefore, each week in this chamber, we advocate for those who are employed and strive to assist others in gaining employment. Regarding the EU and our trade relationship, it is noted with interest that the Labour party expresses a desire not to revisit the Brexit debate. Nonetheless, it is evident that an increasing group within the Labour ranks seeks primarily to reintegrate us into the single market.",Conflict
"The Secretary of State has acknowledged that the Government agreed to a “less than ideal result” for the UK’s fishing sector during the Brexit discussions, though I suspect those in Hull might describe it differently. Could the Minister confirm that, once the transition period concludes, our fishing rights will not be exchanged for other political or economic considerations?",Conflict
"I will also oppose the motion today, as I consider it entirely unnecessary. I speak as someone who voted to leave on 23 June last year and who has held a reluctant respect for the Prime Minister’s conduct since she assumed office. Nevertheless, her reasoning for calling a general election is, frankly, not genuine. The claim that she requires a new mandate to negotiate Brexit is unfounded. That mandate was granted on 24 June by a majority of the UK electorate, and it is her responsibility to carry it out. Should she choose to hold another election or referendum at the conclusion of the process, that is a separate matter; however, as my hon. Friend the Member for Walsall North (Mr Winnick) noted, the timing of this justification appears to be purely opportunistic.",Conflict
"Is the Prime Minister aware that when Jean-Claude Juncker described her as “nebulous,” he significantly misjudged the perspective of the British public, who strongly reject that characterization? This is the view I encountered in my constituency over the weekend, where constituents commended the Prime Minister’s resolve to secure an agreement beneficial to my area. Can she demonstrate the same resolve by dismissing the possibility of a second referendum, which would be highly offensive to my constituents and imply that their initial vote was uninformed?",Conflict
"As usual, the hon. Lady raises a noteworthy point. Her contributions have been among the more measured ones during the debate, reflecting her commitment to representing her constituents and others across the United Kingdom.

I observed recently, in relation to the current no-deal situation, that one Conservative MP—specifically, the longest-serving Conservative MP in the House—referred to the “headbanger” faction within the Conservative party. I am unfamiliar with the designations of the other factions, but I found that description striking: members of the party are identifying a “headbanger” group, which appears to constitute a significant segment of the party. While discussing no deal, I also recall the comments attributed to the Dutch Prime Minister, who reportedly likened a vote for no deal to

“the Titanic voting for the iceberg to get out of the way.”

The Chancellor appears to understand this, as reflected in his spring statement today, where he spoke of a smooth and orderly transition potentially jeopardised by no deal. He acknowledged that no deal could pose risks to employment and wages, yet the matter remains under discussion and has not been definitively excluded.",Conflict
"The Social Democratic and Labour Party, the Alliance Party, the Green Party, and Sinn Féin may collectively oppose the DUP on this matter; however, if direct rule is reinstated and Northern Ireland lacks a functioning Government, we will not permit the establishment of any special status contrary to the interests and preferences of the Unionist community. A cross-community agreement is essential on this subject—no alternative approach will be effective without devolution. Should Sinn Féin, the SDLP, the Green Party, and the Alliance Party advocate for special status for Northern Ireland, it can only be achieved through the presence of a devolved Government, which would facilitate consensus-building on this issue. Without a devolved Government, Sinn Féin’s efforts will not succeed; their demonstrations and symbolic actions at the border will not influence Brussels. The only viable means to represent Northern Ireland’s interests is either through having our own Government or by my colleagues and me representing Northern Ireland within this Chamber. I anticipate that a strong DUP delegation will be elected in the forthcoming general election to advocate for Northern Ireland in this House.",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to my hon. Friend for his dedicated efforts on this matter. As he is aware, we have already implemented a points-based immigration system to regain control over our borders. Additionally, we have secured numerous free trade agreements and intend to capitalize on the economic benefits of leaving the European Union by establishing free ports. Our aim is to position this country as the most appealing destination for investment, business, and entrepreneurship globally. Furthermore, we remain committed to opposing the plans of the opposition, who seek to reverse these developments and aim to rejoin the European Union, as advocated by the right hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer).",Conflict
"My hon. Friend has raised an excellent point. Recently, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has been engaging in discussions with the devolved Administrations to secure a successful internal market within the United Kingdom as we depart from the European Union. An agreement has been reached with the Welsh Government. Mark Drakeford, the Labour Minister, has demonstrated a willingness to be flexible and has adopted a constructive stance, which contrasts sharply with the approach taken by the Scottish Government and the First Minister of Scotland, who have prioritized a narrow ideological goal of separation over the interests of the people of Scotland—an occurrence that is not without precedent.",Conflict
"Another matter that I believe is likely to encounter difficulties in the near future is the proposed devolution for East Anglia. For those with a particular interest in this somewhat specialized topic, there is an exceptionally clear and succinct article in this week’s edition of The House magazine explaining why the plan is problematic. I will refrain from further comment, but it appears to bear the influence of a well-known, prominent former Deputy Prime Minister who has recently been quite vocal. I do not anticipate its success. While I am supportive of the northern powerhouse initiative and devolution for Greater Birmingham and Greater Manchester, the proposal for East Anglia does not seem viable. It lacks support, is unpopular, involves significant costs that have not been fully outlined, and therefore the Government should reconsider and abandon these plans.",Conflict
"No. According to Conservative party standards, the Europe Minister currently serving on the Front Bench is considered moderate and sensible, having over time carefully weighed many perspectives on European matters. It is surprising that a person of his standing is not only fulfilling the role of an effective Europe Minister, which he is, but also carrying out the more difficult tasks for the Conservative party, creating the impression that, as a reasonable individual, he is overlooking the significant criteria established by the Electoral Commission.

Lastly, any inquiry about leaving the European Union must acknowledge that such a departure would require negotiation. Perhaps the appropriate question would be, “Should the United Kingdom negotiate its withdrawal from the European Union under Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty?” Any such question should explicitly recognize that the UK is currently a member of the European Union, and the issue at hand is whether the UK should continue its membership.",Conflict
"This statutory instrument illustrates a significant shortcoming by the Government in relation to Brexit. It demonstrates how leaving the EU without an agreement poses serious challenges to UK industry, alongside important safeguards for public health and the environment. In addition to implementing the modifications recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee and the Lords EU Select Committee, the Government should promptly remove the option of a no-deal exit.",Conflict
"There are significant uncertainties involved in this matter, and I do not wish to add to the concerns of the Treasury Bench. What I will state is that considerable risks exist. I acknowledge that the Government has a valid point here; however, if that is so, the appropriate discussion that should occur between members of the Treasury Bench and the House is focused on how we develop and amend this legislation to both highlight the statutory procedures to be followed and ensure that the only situations in which these procedures are not followed—clause 9 being an example—are those where obtaining an extension under article 50 to allow the statutory process to be completed prior to departure would be impossible. Pursuing this approach would lead to more constructive dialogue in this House, rather than the argumentative exchanges witnessed in recent days.",Conflict
"It should be evident that if the Prime Minister’s agreement is presented to the House for a fourth time—assuming it is permitted—it will not succeed, as it has been unsuccessful on the three previous occasions.

I want to clarify that Labour does not support the proposal to pass the withdrawal agreement Bill without a mutually agreed deal in place. Doing so would be putting the process in the wrong order, and therefore Labour intends to vote against the Bill at its Second Reading. How does the Secretary of State expect a Bill designed to implement a deal that has not yet been presented to the House to be approved within two weeks—or is the intention simply to extend the Prime Minister’s tenure for another week and provide her with support in today’s 1922 Committee meeting?",Conflict
"Can the Minister confirm that in his conversations with international colleagues he will firmly contend that the protocol must not remain in place? Will he clarify that it has dismantled the Belfast agreement, weakened democratic processes in Northern Ireland, raised expenses for both consumers and businesses, interfered with trade between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, redirecting it towards the Republic, and that the EU is employing it deliberately as a means to penalise the UK for its departure from the EU, irrespective of the impact on the people of Northern Ireland?",Conflict
"I express my gratitude to the Leader of the House for outlining the limited agenda for the upcoming week. While this is a recurring observation, it remains noteworthy. Norman Lamont once characterized the Major Government, which faced similar difficulties and disorder, by saying they “give the impression of being in office but not in power.”

In contrast, this Government fails even to convey the appearance of being in office, much less of exercising power. Initially, they declined to participate in votes on Opposition day motions; now, they simply abstain from voting altogether.

With the Democratic Unionist Party’s support clearly withdrawn, the Government is beginning to confront the realities of operating as a minority administration, recognizing that securing approval for legislation is no longer guaranteed. The only factor that may work in their favour is Labour’s lack of discipline and inconsistent voting presence. Notably, we succeeded in passing two amendments to the Finance Bill on Tuesday—an achievement exceeding what was accomplished in the previous two decades—so congratulations to this persistently struggling Government. Might we have a discussion on parliamentary democracy to clarify the Government’s stance on the fundamental principle of voting?",Conflict
"Certainly not. Only a person with no comprehension or one acting in bad faith would inquire about the origins of the violence as if mere hope justified disregarding a solemn peace agreement. Such a misleading question, posed repeatedly, can only come from someone who either lacks understanding or deliberately attempts to mislead. It is well known that regrettably, individuals across the political spectrum have at times exploited violence as a pretext. This is precisely why my party, alongside others, undertook the substantial efforts required to secure peace, whereas your party remained on the sidelines, protested, and sought to undermine the Good Friday Agreement at every opportunity. Therefore, I will not accept insincere questions or lectures, thank you.",Conflict
"Does the sequencing method in negotiations exemplify the application of best efforts or the practice of negotiating in good faith? I argue that it does not. It is now apparent to most impartial observers that the EU’s current reading of the Northern Ireland protocol is being employed as leverage in the discussions. In what way does this reflect negotiating in good faith? This legislation will guarantee that Northern Ireland continues to be part of the UK’s customs territory and that businesses in Northern Ireland maintain unrestricted access to Great Britain markets. Nevertheless, I must record that further measures are necessary concerning Northern Ireland, having listened to very impactful and persuasive contributions from Unionist colleagues today and in the past.",Conflict
"Several of my colleagues appropriately expressed their worries regarding the backstop designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland: a hard border that had previously been ruled out prior to becoming a political topic by HMRC Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland customs and excise authorities, who confirmed that the current infrastructure adequately manages the border on the island; a border that all involved parties—the EU, the Republic of Ireland, and the UK—had agreed would not be established; and a border deemed unnecessary for security reasons by the WTO.",Conflict
"Certainly. As has been noted, we had additional time to consider the Scotland Bill. It is likely that this will not be the final piece of legislation concerning Scotland; I observe that the Secretary of State for Scotland is now present. He will probably need to guide another Scotland Bill through this Parliament as a consequence of Brexit, in order to confer the powers he previously promised.

This marks only the start. The Government intends to introduce the great repeal Bill, increasingly referred to as “the great power grab.” They must be prepared to face the examination of this House. We have been elected to perform a duty, and that is the task we have undertaken this evening with our amendments. We will continue to fulfil this responsibility throughout the consideration of this Bill and all forthcoming legislation related to Brexit. [Interruption.]",Conflict
"Prime Minister, the challenge you are currently encountering revolves around the withdrawal agreement and the involvement of Northern Ireland within these negotiations. This weekend, the Irish Government stated that the entire basis of the withdrawal agreement lacks a solid foundation. They affirmed that there will be no inspections at the Irish border; consequently, there will be no risk to peace in Northern Ireland; and thus, no interruption to the island of Ireland. Today, we hear that this is due to Northern Ireland not being ready, yet all preparations undertaken by the central Government also pertain to Northern Ireland. When will you cease using Northern Ireland as a justification, and do you understand that the significance of this agreement, both for implementing Brexit and for maintaining the Union of the United Kingdom, means that we will not accept being subjected to intimidation tactics to advance this process?",Conflict
"Regarding the European referendum and the approach to securing a victory, the most disadvantageous outcome for the campaign advocating continued membership in Europe would be for a succession of the Chancellor’s establishment representatives to assert to the public that withdrawal from the European Union is unfeasible and unsustainable. While I am a committed supporter of the European Union, I would neither endorse nor recognize a rationale for the establishment collectively claiming that it is impossible for the United Kingdom to exist outside the European Union. Such a top-down campaign led by the establishment would likely generate resentment and provoke a backlash among individuals valuing their autonomy.",Conflict
"The hon. Member for Wallasey (Ms Eagle) revealed her true position when, amidst her strong language and arguments, she expressed a preference for a “much longer delay.” This reflects the wish of the remain majority in this House. I was somewhat surprised to hear the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook) claim that this measure should be completely uncontroversial. He may not have been paying attention, but millions of voters have, and they expected the UK to leave the EU on 29 March. For these individuals, this discussion is a significant disappointment because this order effectively cancels the exit date of 29 March. The manner in which the Council decision was reached highlights precisely the reasons cited by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood) for voting to leave the EU.",Conflict
"During our attempts, we made direct appeals to the Prime Minister in discussions with her and proposed a resolution, understanding, for instance, that the Scottish National Party, Plaid Cymru, and numerous Labour Backbenchers would have supported the single market and customs union. Achieving a consensus was possible, but she categorically declined to engage. Instead, this Prime Minister has guided us—indeed, the sole area where she has taken the lead—into this unfortunate situation. She was unwavering in setting her red lines, and at every opportunity to modify or relax them, she declined to do so.",Conflict
"I extend my congratulations to my right hon. Friend the Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford) not only for obtaining this timely and significant debate but also for his address and the manner in which he comported himself amid what can only be described as unacceptable conduct from certain Conservative Members.

I express my gratitude to Mr Speaker for permitting this debate. It is reasonable to observe that his guidance over recent weeks has been markedly different from that demonstrated by the leaders of both the Conservative and Labour parties.

The Prime Minister characterized discussions around the prospect of a second Brexit referendum as a betrayal of the initial vote or as a direct affront to democratic principles. I may be mistaken, but I do not recall a previous Prime Minister asserting that providing the public an opportunity to express their views on an issue is inherently undemocratic.

The subject before us today concerns the genuine failure to uphold the outcome of the first referendum. This Prime Minister has been responsible for implementing that decision, yet she has pursued a course of action likely to result in failure. Accordingly, it is this Prime Minister who has not honoured the referendum result, having faltered due to reluctance to confront the European Research Group's more hardline Brexiteers, fearing they might submit letters of no confidence to challenge her leadership.",Conflict
"Sixty-two per cent of individuals in Scotland voted to remain, so I am quite content to be included in that group. Approximately 7,500 of his constituents and 14,500 of mine have signed the petition to revoke Article 50. The right hon. Gentleman holds the position of Secretary of State for Scotland, and with Scotland opposing Brexit, when will he fulfill his responsibilities, advocate for Scotland, challenge the Prime Minister, and prevent Scotland from being removed from the European Union without its consent?",Conflict
"Fundamentally, this Bill is highly unadvisable, to say the least, and from a practical perspective, it is also misguided and likely to have adverse effects. As my right hon. and learned Friend pointed out, a lasting resolution cannot be achieved through a one-sided effort to enforce one party’s position on a jointly agreed international treaty. Naturally, there is no basis to expect that this will alter the EU’s stance regarding Northern Ireland. Why would it? The EU’s main concern is the perceived unreliability of the UK, and rather than reducing this concern, the Bill actually serves to heighten it. Should the EU respond with a concession—should it unexpectedly reach a new agreement with the UK driven by the pressure this legislation is meant to exert—there would be little reason for the EU to trust that the UK would honour such an agreement. This would undermine the entire justification for the approach. Moreover, as has been outlined earlier today, this represents only the initial stage of the possible complications that may arise.",Conflict
"I have submitted this urgent question primarily to obtain clarification, and secondly, to request that the Minister, in good faith, explain what the Prime Minister meant when he responded with “No,” as he has not yet provided an explanation. Referring to my earlier comments about respect within this House, I believe that very few members here, and indeed very few people in the country, given recent developments, have confidence in the Prime Minister’s statements, even when delivered from this Dispatch Box. The Prime Minister used the term “no” in direct response to my question—[Interruption.] Therefore, I have several questions for the Minister, and I trust that, with this mutual respect, he will address them straightforwardly.

Firstly, what course of action does the Prime Minister plan to take if a deal is not approved by this House by 19 October, nor is there an affirmative vote in favour of no deal? That is my first question.",Conflict
"That is entirely incorrect. The right hon. Gentleman is fully aware that our perspectives on Brexit are fundamentally at odds. I believe the EU, acting in good faith, would probably agree to a legitimate request for an extension, for example, one intended to allow a people’s vote. In the end, it would be for the House to determine whether, if such a recommendation were presented, it should not be enacted into law.",Conflict
"In the paper released yesterday, the Chancellor asked:

“Does withdrawing from global engagement best protect our national security?”

I trust he does not mean to imply that those advocating for the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union seek to withdraw from international affairs, as this is not accurate. Our aim is for the United Kingdom to liberate itself from the restrictive constraints of the EU and its overarching institutions, and to engage fully with the wider world, reflecting its status as the world’s fifth largest economy, a nuclear-armed nation, and a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council.",Conflict
"Not intentionally—but on a few occasions, unintentionally. [Laughter.] The hon. Gentleman refers to my considerable length of service, which is the one aspect of my time in this House that is not disputed. Nearly all of my former colleagues from various Governments have now been elevated to the House of Lords, where they continue to discuss these very issues. In fact, all the colleagues who served in Governments alongside me—especially during the periods of Margaret Thatcher and John Major—who remain with us and are members of the House of Lords, are supporting this motion. They share the same view, as it is entirely without precedent for us to find ourselves in a situation like this.",Conflict
"Parliament has been effective in blocking Brexit proposals but less successful in delivering Brexit solutions. There are numerous reasons to argue for a delay, and I could readily outline several concerns I have with the terms of the current deal, which is somewhat less focused on Europe than the earlier proposal. However, the previous deal never gained sufficient support to pass through the House, unlike this one. Let us be clear: the likelihood of reopening the deal is very low. If anyone intends to vote against the Second Reading, they should openly acknowledge that their opposition is based on a desire for a second referendum or to cancel the triggering of article 50.",Conflict

"This Government is currently experiencing significant disorder, and the country is similarly unsettled as a result of this situation. I left my office at 3:20 pm. At that point, officials at Downing Street could not confirm who would be addressing my urgent question. It appears that a WhatsApp group or a form of random selection has designated the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) to respond to the House, despite my question being directed to the Prime Minister.

Information has emerged from journalists and the Irish Government indicating that the Prime Minister may be travelling to Strasbourg this evening, or alternatively may not be going, mere hours before a scheduled meaningful vote. On 26 February, the Prime Minister clearly stated:

“I want to reassure the House by making three further commitments. First, we will hold a second meaningful vote by Tuesday 12 March at the latest”—

with still 24 hours remaining, it is uncertain what will happen. She also promised a vote on a no-deal scenario by 13 March and a vote on whether to extend article 50 by 14 March. She concluded:

"The Government’s promise to hold a referendum also diminishes the United Kingdom’s leverage in negotiations with other EU member states. Members of the Opposition support substantial reform of the European Union, but such reform cannot be achieved by threatening our European counterparts. While my right hon. Friend, the shadow Foreign Secretary, has clearly outlined the type of EU reform he desires, the Prime Minister’s speech last week lacked specificity regarding which powers he intended to reclaim. In fact, he did not even use the term “repatriation,” much to the apparent frustration of his Back Bench colleagues. Furthermore, he did not clarify how he would conduct a campaign if the negotiation proved unsuccessful. When the Minister concludes, it would be helpful for both the House and the public if he clarified this uncertainty by specifying which powers the Conservative Party aims to retrieve. It would also be useful to understand their approach, if one exists, and why they believe the proposed timing in 2017 aligns with any developments within the European Union. Chancellor Merkel has expressed limited enthusiasm for treaty changes, and it remains uncertain whether any treaty amendments will occur before 2017.",Conflict
"Shortly before Christmas, we erred by narrowly voting to grant Parliament the final say on any agreement. This decision diminished the leverage of our negotiators. The European Union now recognizes that any agreement reached could be rejected, which may encourage them to negotiate more firmly. To offer a brief analogy, if I were interested in purchasing your car, Madam Deputy Speaker, regardless of any unusual sticker on the windshield, both parties desire something: I want the vehicle, and you want the payment. At the beginning of negotiations, both sides must be willing to walk away. This is the point emphasized by my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (John Redwood), and it reflects standard business practice. In summary, using another analogy, one does not reveal one’s cards when playing poker.",Conflict
"It is essential that the Government and its departments provide comprehensive assistance and cooperation to the Culture Committee, the Electoral Commission, and the Mueller investigations. Although I recognize this does not fall within the Minister’s direct responsibilities, I would appreciate confirmation from him that such cooperation will be ensured, particularly given reports that the Mueller team was recently in London and expressed dissatisfaction with the level of cooperation from UK authorities. The Intelligence and Security Committee, however, has significantly more unrestricted and direct access to our intelligence and security agencies and is able to question them directly. This underscores the importance of its re-establishment.

In spite of the growing body of evidence in recent months, the Foreign Secretary maintained last week that he had not seen any proof of Russian interference. Yet on Monday, the Prime Minister conveyed a notably different message in her Mansion House speech. She strongly condemned the Putin administration for engaging in hacking, meddling in elections, and disseminating disinformation aimed at creating division within Western democracies and undermining the international system.",Conflict
"My hon. Friend makes a valid point. Supporting a different party effectively allows the possibility of a Labour Government, which would neither pursue renegotiation nor hold a referendum.

Such a claim lacks credibility because it is inaccurate.",Conflict
"The hon. Lady appears to have overlooked a straightforward and fundamental fact: the European Union cannot engage in negotiating or finalizing the legal agreement for the future trade relationship with the United Kingdom while the UK remains a member of the EU. Such negotiations can only commence after the UK has exited the Union. Therefore, if she wishes to advance discussions on the future relationship, she should support the deal being presented this evening. This will allow us to proceed to the next phase.

While the backstop is a significant issue, it was not the sole matter of concern for hon. Members. Another point raised related to the political declaration, since, as the hon.

Members expressed uncertainty about how they could be assured regarding the nature of the future relationship the Government intends to pursue.",Conflict
"Nonetheless, the situation is as it stands. It is evident that the Brexit process must be managed in a manner that does not negatively affect the Good Friday agreement. I have listened attentively to Members of the DUP and fully recognise that any proposal suggesting that leaving the EU would entail separating Northern Ireland and placing it under a distinct regulatory framework to uphold the Good Friday agreement, or to ensure regulatory alignment with the Republic of Ireland, is entirely unacceptable. I found the Prime Minister’s statements and the agreement she reached did not indicate any intention to pursue such a course. Were she to do so, I must say she would quickly lose the support of her party, which is united in its position on this issue, regardless of whether Members strongly supported Brexit or opposed it. Consequently, this matter must be set aside.",Conflict

The Opposition aim to shift today’s debate towards the question of merits. I advise my hon. Friend to resist such invitations from Opposition Members and instead require them to confirm if they will endorse a referendum.",Conflict
"In the wake of the referendum outcome, the Government has been tasked with managing the withdrawal and transition negotiations, with further discussions to follow. So far, the agreement has not been approved by Parliament due to the presence of three conflicting factions around the Government: individuals who wish to remain, those who desire a complete exit, and the Labour party, whose unclear position lacks consensus even within its leadership.

They have witnessed directly how membership provides the UK with global influence. Therefore, we should acknowledge the fact that this Government maintains two education departments within Whitehall. The first is the Department for Education, and the second is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It is unfortunate that the Prime Minister has not permitted a greater number of Conservative Eurosceptics to serve in the FCO and benefit from its well-regarded retraining and conversion programme.",Conflict
"Rather than expressing dissatisfaction that the draft withdrawal agreement released this morning suggests maintaining Northern Ireland’s participation in the customs union, the single energy market, and adherence to EU regulations on the environment and agriculture, should Ministers not acknowledge that the root of the issue lies in their ongoing inability to clarify how they intend to maintain an open border while exiting the customs union and single market? When will they provide a clear explanation of their proposed approach?",Conflict
"The Government may assert that it is safeguarding employment rights established under the EU framework; however, it has the option, if it chooses, to gradually reduce those rights as I have described. I anticipate that many Government Members will find this difficult to resist—not by abolishing rights entirely, but by considerably diminishing them. What leads me to this conclusion? One need only examine previous statements made by Cabinet members to understand their perspectives. Despite having heard much on this subject tonight, some of these remarks are sufficiently significant to warrant repetition. To begin with the highest level, the Prime Minister, during an interview with HR magazine in March 2010 while serving as shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, stated:

“Areas of particular concern include the Working Time Directive…and the Agency Workers Directive.”

In 2012, the Foreign Secretary expressed the view that the UK should eliminate the social chapter. The following year, he suggested that the Government should actively engage with all matters related to the “social chapter stuff,” describing the extent of employment regulation as “back-breaking.” Additionally, when the Secretary of State for Defence held the position of Minister for Business and Enterprise, he remarked that the Government must

“apply greater pressure on burdensome red tape,”",Conflict
"It is essential to recall the events that have led us to our current situation. My hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Sir William Cash) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) pointed out that before the Lisbon treaty, these issues were not under the authority of the European Court of Justice. They were previously handled through intergovernmental arrangements. It was the former Labour Government that made the decision resulting in our present circumstances. They placed us in this legal position, which should not have occurred, and it is crucial for us as Conservatives to acknowledge the role of the previous Labour Government. That Government agreed to a treaty initially intended to be subject to a referendum, which ultimately did not take place, and this House was asked to approve a package that, in my view, the British public was not given the chance to accept or reject.",Conflict
"Rather than fostering unity, harmful language and divisive rhetoric have taken root, affecting not only our political environment but also broader society. Similarly, just as the Government has not sought to engage with the wider country, it has also failed to reach out to the rest of this House. At the beginning of his remarks, which now seem some time ago, the Attorney General claimed that reaching this stage was done reluctantly. This assertion does not hold. Every decision made throughout the process—decisions deliberately and knowingly taken by the Prime Minister—has brought us inevitably, not hesitantly, to the current situation.

It is unacceptable that an entire month has been lost simply due to delaying tactics because the Prime Minister feared defeat in the vote, a defeat that is nonetheless expected this evening.

"During the period in which the discussions were taking place, successive Cabinet Ministers issued statements that contradicted the proposals put forward by their colleagues present in the negotiations. The Foreign Secretary, the Leader of the House, the International Trade Secretary, and the Treasury Chief Secretary all stated unequivocally that they would reject any agreement involving a customs union. Meanwhile, various candidates for the Conservative Party leadership each made clear that they would not uphold any compromise arrangement. Consequently, regardless of what the Prime Minister might propose, it is evident that no compromise would endure the forthcoming Conservative leadership election. Reports of numerous leaks from the Cabinet yesterday indicate that the Prime Minister was unable to secure approval for the compromise deal she sought from her own Cabinet, and the reduced proposal that resulted failed to satisfy any party—neither her own Backbenchers, nor the Democratic Unionist Party, nor the Official Opposition. Therefore, no Labour Member of Parliament can support a deal based on the assurances of a Prime Minister with only a few days remaining in office.",Conflict
"Since the SNP Government assumed office in 2007, the value of Scotland’s food exports has more than doubled, with companies in my constituency experiencing strong growth. What evaluation has the Department conducted regarding the effects of Brexit on this significant growth, or is the approach more hopeful than analytical? At 9.21 this morning, I received a reply from the Scotland Office concerning a question I directed to the Secretary of State for Scotland, which revealed that the Scotland Office has not carried out any assessment of Brexit’s impact on Scottish trade.",Economic

"The Department for International Trade’s responsibilities extend beyond Brexit, and I commend my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for International Trade, for his efforts in identifying and expanding trade opportunities globally. For many years, our nation has not achieved its full potential in this area. The international market does not guarantee success to us. If we do not actively promote and sell our products and services, we risk missing out on important economic benefits necessary for the country. Prosperity will not be handed to us; we must proactively engage. The initiatives outlined in the Queen’s Speech aimed at enhancing our trade outcomes are very much appreciated.",Economic
"It is the duty of any Government to safeguard its population from threats to society, encompassing national security, economic stability, and social unity. In 2008, the previous Government acted promptly in response to the global financial crisis that caused significant hardship for many. Ten years later, several members of the current Government support a no-deal Brexit, which I believe would increase public hardship—a scenario that, according to the Bank of England, could result in consequences more severe than the 2008 financial collapse.

It is uncommon for both the Confederation of British Industry and the Trades Union Congress to present a unified stance, yet both oppose a no-deal Brexit. The present situation is more serious than that of 2008 because the Government would be intentionally and knowingly imposing such an outcome on the UK economy and, consequently, on local communities. It is notable that the Chancellor stated just a few hours ago that the Government’s Brexit strategy is business-friendly, despite numerous statements that seem to contradict this claim.",Economic
"Hearing the discussion today, I am reminded of the difference from when I, like many colleagues, sought election to this House and was told that a magic money tree did not exist. Now, in my inaugural Budget, I learn that such a thing does indeed exist—quite extraordinary.

The Budget appears to have been largely financed by the abandonment of a planned cut to corporation tax, alongside an unprecedented increase in projected borrowing. I acknowledge the government’s response to the coronavirus crisis as measured and timely. My request is that the UK Government maintains close collaboration with the Scottish Government, providing clear details regarding the funding allocated, to ensure ongoing effective cooperation between the administrations.

Addressing a significant external shock such as coronavirus is one matter; addressing the consequences of a self-imposed challenge such as Brexit is another. According to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s report, which contains figures that might be unexpected in public discourse, page 27 indicates that trade with the EU is projected to be 15% lower after ten years, with productivity declining by 4%. Additionally, a free trade agreement is forecast to reduce Scottish GDP by 6% by 2030, increasing to 8.5% in the event of no deal.",Economic
"The aspect I wish to highlight, which has received limited attention in this debate, concerns the opportunities this Bill provides to reconsider the provision of advice and guidance within the market in this country. Numerous challenges faced by consumers when making personal financial decisions have been noted. Financial advice tends to be costly, and the guidance available can often be quite general. While services such as the Money Advice Service and Pension Wise remain available and I encourage constituents to utilise them where possible, the Bill enables a renewed examination of the financial advice sector. This is facilitated by advancements in technology and the significant function of the FCA’s regulatory sandbox, which permits experimentation in this area.",Economic
"We have secured another excellent trade agreement that exemplifies a key reason why many chose to leave the European Union: the ability to establish our own independent trade policies.

"Regarding trade agreements and our connection with Europe, it has been noted that 60% of our trade occurs with the EU. For producers of lamb, steel, automobiles, or aerospace components, seamless trade is extremely significant. While the Prime Minister asserts, “It’ll all be all right on the night” and emphasizes sovereignty, the matter extends beyond sovereignty alone; it concerns employment, livelihoods, and the future of individuals. Those who voted to leave the EU did not intend to forfeit their jobs.

In conclusion, I find some reassurance, albeit limited, in the Secretary of State’s continued positive remarks about the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon and the lagoon project in north Wales. The impact of climate change is severe. It is understood that 80% of fossil fuel reserves must remain unused to prevent irreversible climate damage. Currently, the price of oil is suppressed due to overproduction and fracking, which releases significant quantities of methane, further exacerbating climate change. Fossil fuel companies are holding onto assets that may become worthless, and financial markets are expected to shift away from this sector eventually. Therefore, investment is needed now in environmentally sustainable energy initiatives, such as the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon.",Economic
"I am confident that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), representing the Green party, would strongly oppose my view on fracking if she were present, but I welcome the inclusion of provisions on the matter. Fracking appears to be one of the more pragmatic choices for the future energy supply in Britain, as it is comparatively cleaner and more environmentally considerate than other fossil fuels, and it offers significant potential for investment.

Toyota directly employs approximately 3,800 people, Nissan about 7,000, and Honda around 3,400. When considering the indirect jobs supported in the UK—such as those in parts manufacturing and logistics that support their supply chains and just-in-time delivery systems—these employment numbers could potentially double.",Economic
"A White Paper addressing both industrial strategy and international trade should have been published together, given the close connection between trade, employment, and economic development. This raises concerns among Labour Members that the Government may not have thoroughly evaluated the risks that forthcoming trade agreements could pose to jobs and wages. The Government appears to have reversed the proper order of considerations. A trade White Paper ought to clearly define the UK’s forthcoming stance on trade defence mechanisms. At present, the EU maintains various trade defence policies, including anti-dumping measures targeting China—and to a smaller extent, India and Malaysia—applied to products such as steel, other metals, and solar panels. The UK has historically opposed these measures within the EU framework. With the capability to independently determine trade policy, the Government must clarify whether it intends to maintain that opposition. Should the Government choose not to implement trade defence measures, it must explain how it will safeguard and support vulnerable industries, including steel and solar panel manufacturing, from the impact of low-cost imports.",Economic

"I propose an idea that will incur no expenses for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Once the EU referendum campaign concludes and, it is hoped, the nation is persuaded that remaining in the EU is advantageous, I would like to see Ministers who have recently expressed support for EU membership occasionally highlighting the benefits of our participation. The challenge over the coming four months is that many of these Ministers, who have now correctly acknowledged that we are better off in the EU overall, have not previously emphasized some of the positive aspects. Encouraging Ministers to speak more favorably about the EU will not require any additional funding from the FCO.

Regarding Syria, it would be useful to have clarity on how the budget accounts for anticipated actions following a ceasefire. Should the ceasefire be maintained and some level of stability be achieved in Syria, it is evident that the FCO will need to allocate a significant financial contribution towards increased involvement in the subsequent stabilisation efforts.

The Government holds the view that the regulations presented to the House are necessary to guarantee the continuation of an effective legislative and regulatory framework for construction products once the transition period ends, and that this framework aligns with the commitments outlined in the crucial Northern Ireland protocol.

Recent assessments place London’s financial market as the world’s second most competitive, narrowly behind New York. Consequently, it is expected that London dominates within the UK itself.

"Like other honourable Members who have contributed this evening and on previous occasions, the Liberal Democrats endorse the general principles of the Bill. Given the current geopolitical instability and the increasing interconnectedness of global trade, it is prudent to include measures allowing the Secretary of State to intervene in business transactions that could have implications for national security. Nevertheless, it is crucial that the scope of such legislation is precisely defined to ensure that transactions posing genuine risks are identified, while not imposing unnecessary restrictions on those that should proceed without hindrance.

The issues highlighted regarding the Bill mainly concern the breadth of its definitions, which may be overly expansive, and the ease with which the Secretary of State’s authority to review transactions might be invoked. This situation could generate uncertainty among investors, as a wide range of activities might fall under the Secretary of State’s jurisdiction. Such uncertainty risks dampening investment at a critical time when the UK is seeking to establish new trade agreements with international partners to compensate for the trade lost following its departure from the European Union.",Economic

This situation highlights the core challenge that has consistently been central to the negotiations.

The Prime Minister has not avoided this challenge; the agreement he has negotiated incorporates it. This presents a key question for future Governments and Parliaments: should we build upon this agreement to guarantee that the UK maintains high standards and that our businesses can trade with the EU market as freely as possible with minimal disruption; or should we opt to reduce standards and remove protections, thereby creating additional obstacles for our businesses trading with our closest and most significant partners?",Economic

"The annual export value of Scotch whisky from this nation totals £6 billion, representing 21% of all food and drink exports and equating to 41 bottles exported every second.

Therefore, it is imperative that the Government takes all necessary actions to safeguard this sector. These initiatives are being introduced at a time when the UK Prime Minister continues to assert that a no-deal Brexit could occur within days, a situation that could lead to the imposition of substantial tariffs on our exports to the EU. Such tariffs would pose a considerable challenge for British manufacturers.

The effect of these tariffs on key markets would be substantial, especially for goods like Scotch whisky. The establishment of new trade agreements with other countries would not be sufficient to counteract this immediate threat.

As a Unionist, I frequently remind constituents in Northern Ireland that the assistance provided to businesses, ongoing furlough payments to employees, support for the self-employed, and similar measures have been possible because we belong to the United Kingdom, the world’s fifth-largest economy. Without financial backing from the UK Treasury, navigating this situation would have been extremely difficult. Additionally, the health service has benefited from the vaccination programme.

The measure would also include events such as funfairs, which have faced significant challenges this year, with numerous traditional fairs across the country being cancelled. Continuing the VAT reduction could provide a necessary stimulus to the events, tourism, and hospitality industries, which are in need of support.

To address any notion—beyond the speculative ideas put forward by nationalist politicians in Scotland and in this chamber—that there is a desire to dissolve this highly successful Union of nations known as the United Kingdom, consider the following facts: Scottish exports to the rest of the UK amount to £46 billion; exports from Scotland to global markets total £17 billion; and exports from Scotland to the EU27 stand at £13 billion. The Fraser of Allander Institute states that 125,000 Scottish jobs are linked to EU exports—none of which I wish to see lost—but 529,000 Scottish jobs depend on trade with the rest of the United Kingdom.

"I am worried that during this discussion there has been very little mention—indeed, almost no mention—of productivity, which is essential for achieving the economic growth required. Nevertheless, I commend the Government for apparently nearing the conclusion of Brexit, addressing the matter of the Northern Ireland protocol, and working to eliminate the restrictive measures that remained in place after our departure from the European Union. Should this Government succeed in fully implementing Brexit, they will have my complete backing.",Economic
"During last week's session of Prime Minister’s Questions, the Leader of the Opposition referenced statements from the National Farmers Union, which described a no deal Brexit as an “Armageddon scenario.” To that, it should be noted that Panasonic plans to relocate its European headquarters from London to Amsterdam in October; on 11 September, Unilever announced it will end its dual Anglo-Dutch structure and establish Rotterdam as its primary headquarters; and Jaguar Land Rover has communicated to the Prime Minister that a no deal outcome would threaten “tens of thousands” of jobs. Regarding science and research, government technical notes indicate that UK institutions would lose eligibility for three Horizon 2020 funding streams, resulting in an estimated £520 million annual loss for UK research, as well as diminished collaboration opportunities with international scientific partners.

A no deal Brexit would also affect national security. The National Police Coordination Centre has indicated that the “necessity to call on military assistance is a real possibility.”",Economic
"In conclusion, may I pose two questions to the Minister? Does he acknowledge that his Government ought to secure an agreement on regulatory equivalence with the EU regarding financial services? Additionally, does he concur that UK financial services should be central to all forthcoming trade discussions to support the development of a constructive future for this vital industry?",Economic
"The UK Government has made and continues to make investments that are separate from any assistance provided by the EU. Similar to Scotland, Wales, as a devolved administration, benefits from direct support from the UK Government. The 2020 Budget marked the largest annual increase in direct funding to Wales in ten years. Investments by the UK Government throughout Wales include £1.5 billion allocated to railway infrastructure, £120 million designated for the north Wales growth deal, and £5 million aimed at connected communities. Additionally, the Welsh Government received £2.8 billion via the Barnett formula from the UK Government to assist individuals, businesses, and public services during the covid-19 pandemic. Over 316,000 jobs in Wales were furloughed, and financial support was provided to 100,000 self-employed individuals.

Moving forward, both central and devolved Governments must concentrate on supporting businesses and individuals as they prepare to take advantage of the opportunities starting 1 January 2021. As a sovereign United Kingdom, it is believed that we can provide what is required for the country's success.",Economic

Friend that I hold the same position as he and the Environment Secretary regarding the ability, after we exit the EU, to regulate the entry of vessels not registered in the UK into our waters, which will be subject to negotiation.

"It is a privilege to address this House on any occasion, and it is particularly significant to speak on this matter, which holds great importance for people throughout Northern Ireland and indeed the entire United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We have heard some excellent contributions, and I express my gratitude to all those who have spoken constructively.

I openly state my satisfaction in serving as the Member of Parliament for Strangford, a role that remains one of the key highlights of my life. It is always a privilege to represent the views of my constituents here, and a clear majority have voiced their opposition to the Irish sea border and the limitations it brings. Ninety-nine per cent of businesses in my constituency have indicated their concerns.

The hon. Member for North Down (Stephen Farry) mentioned that businesses are performing well. While his constituency is nearby, his experience seems quite different from mine. I find it difficult to follow his perspective. During last week’s Northern Ireland questions, the Secretary of State noted that 200 businesses have ceased trading between the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland. In my area alone, at least 200 businesses have stopped trading, so I believe the overall figure is likely higher.",Economic
"For many years, competitive capitalism has been a significant driver of human advancement, yet its reputation has been affected by the impacts of globalisation, regulatory influence, and recurring instances of corporate misconduct. This chamber, associated with figures such as Smith, Locke, and Ricardo, is well positioned to reshape the global argument for capitalism in the context of the twenty-first century as we establish our evolving international role. Central to this effort should be the focus on entrepreneurs, small enterprises, start-ups, and innovators.

The Government ought to reconsider the emphasis on shareholder value as the exclusive objective for companies. While there is a case for streamlining the governance code, it is equally important to strengthen oversight to more effectively limit excesses and ensure companies are held responsible for the broader effects of their activities. Measures are required to reduce the influence of crony capitalism, addressing issues such as problematic privatisations, the repeated awarding of public contracts to the same dominant conglomerates, preventing the public bearing the losses from private risk-taking, and reviewing corporate tax incentives.",Economic
"Nonetheless, there is no certainty that this outcome will be realized. It cannot be assured that the EU will agree to what it might consider an advantageous arrangement: free trade with Europe combined with the ability for the UK to set its own common external tariff and pursue new trade agreements. Consequently, the Government may eventually face a difficult decision between remaining within the customs union and experiencing the reintroduction of tariffs and administrative barriers between British businesses and their largest trading partner. What would be the implications of this? One approach to addressing this question is to examine the Government’s analysis. During oral evidence to the Exiting the EU Committee, the Secretary of State stated that the Department was

“in the midst of carrying out 57 sets of analyses, each of which has implications for individual parts of 85 per cent of the economy.”

In our report, we noted that the Government was exploring different options for market access and recommended:

“For the sake of transparency, these should be published alongside the Government’s plan, provided that doing so does not weaken the Government’s negotiating position.”",Economic
"While it is acknowledged that certain areas of the fishing sector had anticipated a greater increase, and the Government consistently advocated for a resolution more aligned with zonal attachment, the agreement nevertheless represents a notable advancement in a positive direction. To assist the UK fishing sector during the initial five and a half years, the Prime Minister announced shortly before Christmas an investment of £100 million in the UK fishing industry, with plans for detailed proposals on this funding to be presented in due course.

In conclusion, although this is not a direct result of the trade and co-operation agreement, the conclusion of the transition period and the departure from both the customs union and the single market have introduced additional administrative requirements for exports to the EU. It is recognised that businesses have encountered some initial challenges while adapting to these new arrangements. EU authorities are similarly adapting to updated procedures. We are collaborating closely with industry stakeholders and EU authorities to resolve these matters and to maintain the smooth movement of goods to market.",Economic
"Earlier this week, an independent report presented to the Scottish Parliament’s Economy Committee highlighted that Edinburgh has a higher dependence on financial services than any other city in Europe. This places Edinburgh at significant risk if the protections referenced by hon. Members are not maintained. I take this opportunity to acknowledge those hon. Members who arranged this debate.

There are considerable concerns regarding potential job and business losses should full access to the single market be reduced. On Tuesday, leading economists provided evidence to members of the Scottish Parliament on the effects that Brexit and exiting the single market could have on Scotland’s economy. Financial services across Scotland directly and indirectly employ nearly 200,000 individuals, including 20,000 workers from the European Union. The sector contributes £8 billion to Scotland’s economy. Notably, Edinburgh’s economy is more dependent on financial services than London’s, or any other city in the UK. As previously mentioned, Edinburgh’s proportion of financial services activity significantly surpasses that of most major European cities.",Economic
"It is well understood that the leave campaign’s assertion of saving £350 million per week was wholly unfounded. I note that the right hon. Member for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom) assured that any EU subsidies lost by farmers would be compensated by central Government funds. Therefore, I am confident that the House would appreciate a similar assurance today regarding the replacement of any lost research funding. I await the Minister’s response on this matter.

Universities are facing the possibility of significant losses across various areas. How will they be affected in the post-Brexit environment, especially given the anticipated pressures to reduce immigration? Universities have long cautioned that stricter student visa requirements have had a serious negative impact, as the right hon. Member for East Devon (Mr Swire) just mentioned. Sir Keith Burnett, vice-chancellor of the University of Sheffield, has estimated that 40% of his institution’s teaching income is derived from international students, who also contribute £11 billion to the broader UK economy. Between 2013 and 2015, nearly 100,000 students experienced visa curtailments, and from 2010 to 2015, the number of international students coming to the UK decreased by 25%.",Economic

"We have observed businesses expressing confidence in the state of our economy. In August, Dyson revealed plans to invest £200 million in its electric vehicle testing centre located in Wiltshire. Additionally, 2 Sisters Food Group—Bernard Matthews—secured significant new contracts with supermarket chains, supporting the creation of 600 new jobs. The Hut Group has announced the addition of 200 technology positions in Salford. In July, we received £130 million in foreign direct investment within the automotive industry from four companies, leading to approximately 500 new jobs.

Our current efforts are focused on negotiating a Brexit agreement that will benefit the country, respect the decision made by the British public, safeguard employment, preserve the Union, and avoid the establishment of a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. In response, the right hon. Gentleman has stated that he supports new trade agreements and now wishes to remain in the customs union. When questioned about his stance on freedom of movement, he said:

“Labour is not committed to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a principle, but… neither do we exclude it.”

"This evening, I will oppose the initiation of Article 50 as someone who is committed to Britain and as a supporter of parliamentary democracy. I will cast my vote in the interests of my children, my constituents, and the nation, guided by my principles, because I do not believe that the path toward Brexit will result in a Britain that is more prosperous, equitable, fair, or tolerant. On the contrary, it is likely to lead to harsher politics and economic decline.

Despite the positive and patriotic sentiments expressed by members of the Government side during these past two days of debate—during which many excellent and challenging speeches have been made—I find it difficult to accept that leaving the most advanced global market ever established is the best strategy for Britain to become a successful international trading nation. Speaking here in London, the center of the most global and diverse trading city in the world, I cannot see how our economic prospects will be improved by severing ties between this city and other major European cities.",Economic

Last week, I visited Singapore to formalise our new digital economy agreement, which stands as the most advanced trade deal we have ever concluded. The digital sector contributes £150 billion to the economy and supports higher wages, with employees earning approximately 50% above the UK average. This agreement links the UK with the fastest-expanding economies in the Asia-Pacific region and advances our efforts to join Singapore and ten other countries in the trans-Pacific partnership. Joining this partnership would provide access to a free trade zone with a combined GDP of £8.4 trillion, presenting significant opportunities for UK exporters.",Economic
"In Wales, under Labour administration, the Government has allocated funds to areas of greatest necessity, rather than providing council tax relief to large food retailers, which are generating substantial profits, or offering stamp duty relief for purchasers of second holiday homes. Instead, a £2 billion resilience fund has been established, and the Development Bank of Wales is investing in small enterprises to safeguard 141,000 jobs. This represents effective devolution; however, appropriate resources are required to fulfill these responsibilities. Currently, only 2% of rail investment funding is directed to Wales, which comprises 5% of the UK population. There is a need for a high-speed rail connection linking Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, and west Wales to better integrate the Union. The shared prosperity fund should be allocated to, for, and by Wales. The promised Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project and railway electrification are also necessary. Despite these needs, Wales is not receiving its equitable portion of funding, and this issue was not addressed in the Budget statement.",Economic
"It would be somewhat unexpected if I did not concur with my hon. Friend, whose constituency borders mine.

One could reasonably contend that the programme has performed extraordinarily poorly. Over the course of the past seven years, several organisations have received funding from it. The European Movement, which declares its aim as to

“contribute to the establishment of a united, federal Europe”,

was granted nearly £1.5 million.

The French think-tank, Notre Europe, also known as the Jacques Delors Institute—I will refrain from providing as much detail as I did during the Second Reading, since my hon. Friend the Minister is now fully informed about the allocation of funds from this budget line—was founded by the former President of the European Commission and advocates his vision of a European Union as a federation of nation states. During the last multi-annual financial framework period, it received close to £1.87 million from the Europe for Citizens programme. The Brussels-based Union of European Federalists obtained approximately £500,000. Additional organisations, which I did not mention previously, also benefited. There is a notable—said here with some irony—French group called Confrontations Europe. Its website states:",Economic
"I must be clear with the House: a no-deal Brexit would result in a notable decline in the productive capacity of the UK economy in the short to medium term. Given that our economy is currently operating close to full capacity, any fiscal or monetary measures would need to be precisely targeted to avoid triggering inflation, which could exacerbate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on retail prices. Although fiscal and monetary policies might assist in easing the transition to a post-Brexit economic environment, their effects would be temporary and would not prevent the consequences of a smaller economy or the difficulties associated with economic restructuring. The notion that there is an easy, immediate solution available to circumvent the repercussions of a no-deal Brexit is, unfortunately, incorrect.",Economic
"The hon. Member for Cardiff North (Craig Williams) raised the issue of roads, which is indeed a significant concern. I refer specifically to the matter of the Severn Bridge tolls, which have been described as a form of excessive charging. For 52 years, local residents have effectively faced double taxation, and this situation appears likely to persist. It may be appropriate for the Welsh Assembly to investigate this infrastructure matter. It is noteworthy that individuals are paying tolls twice: contributing to the national road network funding for Wales and the west of England, and then again through the bridge tolls.

This House acknowledged, under the Severn Bridges Act 1992, that tolls were to be levied for a specified duration. That duration is expected to conclude later this year or early next year, at which point the Severn bridges should be regarded in the same way as other motorways across the UK, receiving equivalent treatment. Consequently, the expense of upkeep ought to be covered by national funds. This point presents a clear case for the removal of the toll charges.",Economic
"Let us consider the automobile sector. In the event of departure, it would be subject to tariffs of 10%. The expectation is that this sector will manage this impact through flexibility in the labour market, which effectively means reductions in wages. Given that wages constitute only one-third of overall expenses, workers would need to accept a 30% reduction in pay or face unemployment. There are approximately 450,000 jobs potentially at risk.

The hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Boris Johnson) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) have toured textile manufacturing facilities that, if outside the EU, would be subject to a 6.5% tariff. Reducing wages in these factories is challenging, as the Low Pay Commission indicates that the majority of employees earn the minimum wage, placing an estimated 56,000 jobs at risk, predominantly in northern and midlands regions. When I questioned the hon. Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip on this matter, he responded by stating that

“there is no need for them to worry.”

This response may be seen as dismissive, especially considering that, in addition to his parliamentary salary, he receives an extra £250,000 annually for his column in The Daily Telegraph. Such a stance could be regarded as lacking seriousness, and this situation should not be treated lightly.",Economic
"In my view, this specifically involves managing the arrangements related to the financial services industry, which is vital to my region’s economy. It is also essential to the entire UK economy.

Approximately 36% of the people I represent are employed in financial and professional services. The financial services sector as a whole generates around £72 billion in tax revenue.",Economic

I extend my congratulations to the Secretary of State, as well as the ministerial and negotiation teams, for securing the agreement. It is reassuring to see that, as a post-Brexit independent nation, we are capable of finalising such a valuable arrangement.

In my capacity as a member of the International Trade Committee, I have been able to examine the agreement thoroughly and can confirm to the House that it represents a notable enhancement compared to the previous arrangements under the EU. I also want to reassure honourable Members that standards relating to food safety, animal welfare, and similar areas will remain intact.",Economic

These would have gone further by calling for a second referendum. However, it appears we cannot debate these amendments because they would require financial resources that the Bill does not allocate. This is somewhat ironic, considering that the estimated cost of leaving the EU is £45 billion. Allocating £100 million to prevent that outcome seems to be a reasonable investment.",Economic
"Due to the Government’s choice to implement a stringent Brexit approach and conclude the transition phase, financial service firms in the UK have forfeited their passporting privileges within EU member states. The trade and co-operation agreement established by the Government with the EU essentially excluded financial services, thereby endangering numerous positions in the industry along with significant tax income for the Treasury.

Additionally, the United Kingdom experienced the highest growth in investment spending among G7 countries last year. Our daily public spending is currently in surplus for the first time in 16 years, a situation not seen since her party was in government in 2001 and 2002.

For example, Nissan is seeking informal arrangements, and Rolls-Royce has experienced a €4 billion reduction in value due to the pound's revaluation. Chemicals represent our second-largest export, and reports indicate that approximately 20% of chemical producers are either relocating to Ireland or considering such a move.

There is an argument that if trade with the EU declines, opportunities in emerging markets could be pursued. However, those markets typically require exchanges involving migration and visa arrangements, similar to the compromises seen with the EU regarding migration and regulatory intervention, so the overall advantage is unclear.

I recognise that the Government is currently attempting to address the issue, primarily through improvements to fencing and security measures. However, my position, shared by my hon. Friend, is that it is also necessary to address the underlying attraction causing the problem.

The issue of unlawful migration into the country is significant from a public policy perspective. Some may argue that increased immigration could be beneficial, suggesting that these individuals offer low-cost labour, among other points. My view is that the easy access to inexpensive labour diminishes the incentive for employers to modernise their operations, and that for an extended period, Governments have depended on open borders and low wages to support the economy. The challenge with this large-scale migration—particularly the illegal aspect—is that it is fundamentally unsustainable over time concerning the economy, public policy, and public sentiment.",Economic

I detect the Chancellor’s dissatisfaction with the House’s failure to approve the withdrawal agreement, but does he concur that this situation implies many forecasts will inevitably need to be adjusted as the Brexit process unfolds in the coming months?

The Chancellor referred to the upcoming Comprehensive Spending Review and education funding. May I also encourage him to give careful and thorough consideration to investment in further education colleges, which constitute a vital element in enhancing the nation’s productivity?

The recent Budget report from the Treasury Committee indicated that the Chancellor is effectively disregarding the fiscal aim of maintaining a balanced budget in the mid-2020s, and the OBR has stated today that this target will not be achieved again.

That the draft Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, which were presented to this House on 13 October, be approved.

In recent years, the EU has established a series of product-specific rules through the ecodesign directive and the energy-labelling framework regulation. Ecodesign regulations aim to reduce both the cost and environmental impact of products used in homes and businesses by setting minimum energy efficiency standards. Energy labelling regulations provide consumers with details about a product’s energy performance to help them make informed choices when purchasing. In 2020, these policies are expected to save households around £100 per year on energy bills, as well as reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 million tonnes of CO2, while promoting innovation and competitiveness within industry.

The purpose of this statutory instrument is clear. It modifies retained EU law to ensure the ecodesign and energy labelling framework continues to function effectively in the UK after the transition period concludes at the end of this year. Additionally, the SI implements the Northern Ireland protocol and ensures seamless access regarding ecodesign and energy-labelling regulations.",Economic

According to the Government’s own analysis of the industry’s future, there is a potential opportunity worth £3.8 billion in steel demand by 2030.

Pritex, based in Wellington, produces sound-proofing materials for the automotive sector. Its chief executive, who also leads the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, has firmly stated that the automotive industry functions entirely on an EU-wide basis; this represents a £15 billion trade for the UK, underscoring the necessity of remaining within the EU.

Friend the Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell) mentioned earlier, this is a minor matter since it does not involve a substantial sum of money.

With the House's permission, I will focus on two specific areas. Firstly, as Members will be aware, an important issue raised concerns the country’s aim to continue accessing the single passport system for financial services within European Union member states. This system allows a firm authorized to perform a particular activity in one member state to undertake the same activity in other member states without needing additional authorization or regulation. It would be helpful to receive clarification from the Minister and the Secretary of State on whether there is an intention to maintain this arrangement.",Economic
"On this occasion, I find myself in agreement with the hon. Gentleman. That is why I chose to address the matter by stating that individuals could come here to work but would be ineligible for full access to our welfare system for a period of four years. This response was intended to address the concerns raised by both his constituents and mine, namely that there should not be benefits without contribution. It is important to recognize that European Union member states view the single market as encompassing not only the free movement of goods, people, services, and capital, but also as including the financial contributions that member countries make to the EU. These payments are intended to support the most vulnerable members and those nations that have recently transitioned from communism. While it is possible to seek modifications to these arrangements—as I have done—it is essential to consider this perspective during the negotiation process.",Economic
"In the first three quarters of this year, exports from Northern Ireland to Ireland amounted to €2.8 billion, representing a 60% increase compared to the same timeframe in 2020.

"The Labour Party will persist in participating positively in discussions, acknowledging the outcome of the referendum and focusing on protecting employment, industry, and living standards through establishing a close economic partnership with the European Union and achieving seamless trade alongside enhanced rights and standards.

We do not perceive any benefit in the plans put forward by the Secretary of State for International Trade to increase separation and differences in our trading relationship with our principal trading partner.",Economic

Although we may find ourselves in different Division Lobbies this evening, I share her commitment to protecting the jobs and livelihoods of our constituents. This commitment underpins my choice to oppose the motion tonight, and I wish to explain three reasons for this decision. Firstly, for many of us on the Opposition Benches, the agreement that the Prime Minister secured from Strasbourg at the last moment fails to address the core issue. Our objections to her deal are unrelated to the Northern Irish backstop. Throughout the debates on leaving the European Union, right hon. and hon. Members have raised concerns about the economy and trade at a rate three times greater than those related to the backstop.",Economic
"Both my constituents and the nation are seeking clarity. Can the Leader of the House agree to adjust the recess schedule and arrange for the House to meet prior to Christmas and/or from 2 January, if required, to prevent the possibility of a no-deal Brexit?

"May I address the hon. Member for St Albans (Mrs Main) by suggesting that, in her consideration of the referendum, she might also contemplate why the 3.5 million individuals most directly impacted by that referendum were not permitted to participate, and whether, as a result, the outcome truly represented the entire will of the nation?

Any discussion regarding Britain's role on the global stage must take into account the economic consequences of Brexit for the UK. The country's international standing will be significantly influenced by whether Brexit results in us becoming weaker, less affluent, and more isolated than we might otherwise have been. I am certain that the Secretary of State for International Development, if present, would likely accuse me of negativity. However, I would suggest that his optimism sometimes borders on an unrealistic view of the advantages he sees in Brexit. My intention is to concentrate on this point.",Economic

This month, the figure has shown a slight improvement from a historic low, which remains a cause for concern rather than celebration. Exports of food and drink from the United Kingdom to European markets have decreased by 50 per cent.

In-depth discussions concerning the automotive sector or essential rules of origin criteria are not included in the agenda for this week’s critical talks, nor are any additional negotiation sessions scheduled.

"The unintended consequence of the Government’s approach, as highlighted by the right hon.

I encourage the Minister, who appears to grasp the matter and is dedicated to maintaining the prominence of our motor industry in global innovation, to convey to the Treasury that, whether or not there is a new Budget next year, prompt measures must be taken to resolve this problem and support our motor industry.",Economic
"I thank the hon. Gentleman; I will address that shortly.

Regarding the overstatement of advantages and the inaccurate portrayal of the Japanese trade agreement, one key matter remains unresolved, and it is an important precedent to establish correctly. To my knowledge, I have posed a straightforward question to the Secretary of State on three occasions in the House, twice through letters and once via a written parliamentary question, and—she will be aware of what follows—I put the question once more: expressed in pounds and pence, what is the projected increase in UK exports and economic growth attributable to the UK-Japan agreement compared to the EU-Japan agreement that it replaces?",Economic

New clause 15, proposed in my name and supported by my hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Ben Lake) and my right hon. Friend the Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Liz Saville Roberts), would mandate an evaluation of how the procurement chapters affect various sectors of the Welsh economy. It is important to highlight that the Senedd’s Economy, Trade, and Rural Affairs Committee has recommended that future trade agreements include impact assessments for the different sectors and sub-sectors within Wales.

The impact assessments released to date for the Australia and New Zealand free trade agreements lack detailed information specific to Wales, especially concerning the potential effects on sub-sectors and regions within Wales. A comprehensive understanding of the implications of free trade agreements on the Welsh economy is essential to determine the kind of support that businesses and organisations will require from both the Welsh and UK Governments to prepare for their implementation. The availability of detailed economic data to Ministers in Westminster and the Senedd will enhance the effectiveness of this support. As has been noted, farming is not an activity that can be undertaken briefly; it requires commitment over 10, 15, or even 20 years.",Economic
"I will address that specific matter in relation to new clause 14, which has been introduced by the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Mr Leslie). The suggested amendment concerns the transitional phase following the UK’s departure from the EU. I considered the hon. Member’s remarks to be entirely reasonable.

From the Government’s standpoint—which I believe is a commonly held position—we must establish a transitional arrangement between our exit and the establishment of our future relationship, in order to provide businesses and individuals with adequate time to adapt and for new systems to be implemented. It is logical to have a single set of modifications, which aligns with points raised by Opposition Members earlier today. Consequently, we have proposed a defined implementation period during which reciprocal market access would continue under existing conditions, and the UK would remain involved in current security arrangements—recognising that this encompasses more than just the single market.",Economic
"The powers devolved to Scotland have enabled the region to make a number of decisions that differ from those implemented elsewhere in the United Kingdom. For instance, the bedroom tax does not apply to anyone in Scotland. Between 2013 and 2017, the Scottish Government allocated over £125 million to alleviate its effects. Regrettably, similar measures have not yet been adopted in Wales. Differences are also apparent in areas such as public sector wages. The Scottish Government has removed the cap on pay increases for public sector employees, resulting in, for example, a nurse with a salary of £30,000 receiving a 3% pay rise in the upcoming financial year. This contrasts with the approach taken by the Welsh Government, which has stated that action will only be taken if additional funding is provided by Westminster.",Economic
"I would like to remind my right hon. and learned Friend that, as I understand it, he previously supported the Government negotiating a transition period for our exit from the European Union, to cover the interval between our departure on 29 March 2019 and the establishment of the future relationship. We have explained the rationale for ensuring that a free trade agreement, centered on frictionless trade, forms the core of our future relationship—this represents a beneficial trade arrangement for the United Kingdom and also allows us to pursue advantageous trade agreements with other countries globally.",Economic
"I would like to begin by welcoming you to your role, Madam Deputy Speaker. I appreciate the Minister’s overview of the Bill’s key points. The move to revise the ATOL scheme to enhance traveller protection during holidays, and to bring it in line with updates to the EU and UK travel package regulations—updates that were introduced before the widespread use of internet bookings—is certainly a positive step. It is essential to safeguard the public by modernising the UK’s financial protection framework for holidaymakers. Keeping up with developments in the online travel sector is crucial to ensure suitable safeguards are in place, whether consumers book their holidays online or through traditional high street outlets. Additionally, this will facilitate UK businesses in selling holidays across Europe, allowing them to operate under the UK’s ATOL system rather than having to comply with the different regulations in each country. The provisions within this Bill are necessary to address emerging digital business practices and contemporary consumer purchasing habits.",Economic
"There may be potential progress with New Zealand, and once negotiations with TTIP conclude, there might be opportunities to advance discussions with the United States under President Trump, though challenges are likely in both cases. It is essential to secure an agreement with New Zealand, as they are among our closest allies on trade matters, operate a well-managed country, hold a favourable view of us, and align with our stance on free trade. Nonetheless, their initial requirement will likely involve the removal of quotas and tariffs on lamb, which could create difficulties for our already vulnerable agricultural sector, so careful preparation will be necessary.

Any American administration’s primary request—assuming we manage to engage constructively with the current protectionist and isolationist government—will be market access for their beef. While I personally have no objections to hormone-treated beef, substantial negotiations will be required to determine the extent to which we open our market to American products, given their interest in exporting heavily subsidised agricultural goods. They are unlikely to see us as strong negotiating partners considering our current position. I will not elaborate further, but it is clear that the concept of exiting the customs union has inherent constraints.",Economic
"Certainly, and I will address the recovery in specific sectors shortly. The hon. Member is correct regarding the FTSE 100, but if we consider the other indices, the full extent of the impact becomes apparent.

The effect extended beyond share prices. Prior to the referendum, the pound was valued at $1.45.

"Our science sector is a global leader, contributing significantly to the strength of our economy. It serves as a catalyst for employment, with 20% of the UK workforce engaged in science-related jobs, and these roles offer salaries that are 40% above the national average. Science plays a vital role in building the high-skilled, well-paid, and highly productive economy that Labour aims to establish. The UK’s science sector is closely connected to European partners through joint funding arrangements, the unrestricted movement of skilled individuals, and collaborative institutions. I will address each of these aspects.

The Government’s own 2013 report indicates that the growing international nature of UK science, supported in part by cooperation with Europe, has enabled the UK to exceed the United States in scientific productivity. Therefore, I welcome the Government’s commitment to establishing what they describe as

“a far-reaching science and innovation pact”,

but, as highlighted in the Committee’s report, delays are

“undermining the UK’s position as a science superpower”,

“very real threat to scientific progress”,

"The agri-foods sector in my constituency has experienced significant expansion. Notable companies include Willowbrook Foods, Mash Direct, and Pritchitts, also known as Lakeland Dairies. Lakeland Dairies operates three factories, two located in the Republic of Ireland and one in Northern Ireland. This company exemplifies the need for a soft border transition, as their production process involves milk crossing the border on three occasions: initially as liquid milk, then returning as powdered milk, and finally arriving back in Newtownards for packaging and processing before being distributed internationally. Another successful agri-food business in the area is Rich Sauces. It is important to acknowledge that this success involves not only factory workers engaged in production and manufacturing but also the farmers supplying milk and those providing arable products to vegetable companies. These represent the positive developments, and it is essential to establish an appropriate arrangement to support them.",Economic
"The effects on automobile manufacturers have not been adequately addressed. This matter extends beyond simply establishing new trade opportunities worldwide; it concerns a supply chain that is intricately connected across Europe. For example, a standard drive shaft for a family saloon vehicle is produced in six separate European countries. What options will car manufacturers have if tariffs are imposed between the UK and the EU? Just last night, I spoke with a multinational retail company that currently employs 3,000 staff but is relocating to a new site where it will employ 5,000. These employees move between London, Frankfurt, and Paris much like people would commute from North Yorkshire to London, yet they now face the possibility that such movement may no longer be feasible. How has this decision been made without addressing these concerns and providing answers?

An even larger issue exists. Considering the European Union at this delicate phase, I see it as a fragile structure; if the UK removes its foundational support, there is a considerable chance that the entire system could collapse. What begins as a domestic economic challenge could escalate into an international and global economic concern, along with political and security risks. The economy of this country and its national security outlook could be significantly impacted.",Economic

Friend the Chancellor has mentioned, funding is being assured for all recipients of EU structural funds up to 2023, providing some level of certainty moving forward. However, the earlier this House can reach consensus on a suitable agreement and facilitate an orderly exit from the European Union, the sooner this situation can be resolved.",Economic
"Following an arrest on behalf of the USA under legal conditions that closely mirror those of the 1957 treaty, the individual was ultimately extradited to the USA to face terrorism-related charges. Is it desirable to witness situations similar to the Abu Hamza case recurring within our extradition procedures? These instances are not unique examples where the European arrest warrant has proved advantageous; many other cases could be referenced.

The European arrest warrant offers a cost-effective solution. Relying on a mechanism akin to that of 1957 would entail covering legal expenses for extradition processes that could extend over several years, costing the public purse hundreds of thousands of pounds. Both the public and the judiciary express frustration over the lengthy delays in extraditing terrorists. Reverting to the 1957 procedure could establish such protracted processes as standard practice. While this may not have posed significant issues two or three decades ago, given the infrequency of criminals crossing borders at that time, it has become commonplace today.

There are three key points I wish to clarify: the implications of this agreement for manufacturing; its impact on services; and its consequences for the Union. I understand that not all decisions were made solely on economic factors. Certainly, there may be a short-term economic uplift due to investment decisions that had been postponed during the process, but that is not the primary concern. The crucial consideration is the long-term outlook—over the next 10, 20, and 30 years.

"It is a criticism of the new Government that the initial motion presented to Parliament concerns the renewal of Trident, despite numerous other urgent matters facing the nation in the context of Brexit. It is unacceptable that the Government’s priority, along with that of many on the Labour benches, during a period of Conservative austerity and economic uncertainty following the EU referendum, is to allocate billions of pounds to maintain outdated nuclear weapons that are neither desired, necessary, nor usable. With forecasts indicating that debt, deficit, and borrowing will worsen post-Brexit, and with planned cuts exceeding £40 billion to public services by 2020, allocating between £167 billion and £205 billion—figures the Government has yet to clarify—is unjustifiable. The Prime Minister’s first parliamentary vote concerns Trident. Given the current circumstances, this is inappropriate. It does not address the most urgent priorities. Efforts should instead focus on stabilising the economy and resolving the disorder resulting from the Brexit decision.

The Prime Minister has already contradicted the message of her inaugural speech, which many across party lines regarded as significant. She pledged to combat “burning injustice,” a goal we share, yet Trident does not address any injustice. Trident is an unethical, inappropriate, and obsolete weapons system.",Economic

The hon. Member mentioned a briefing published in the weekend media, which he described as seemingly well-informed regarding our intentions. I find it surprising that he considers it necessary to rely on or trust all newspaper reports; I would have assumed that approach could lead to considerable dissatisfaction, so I recommend that he refrains from doing so immediately. To clarify, our proposals for a British Bill of Rights remain consistent. Our objective is to repeal the Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights in its place.

"As Ministers have noted, there will only be one such Bill each year in the future to address the operations of these companies. A limited number of firms are extracting significant sums from our public services due to the expensive nature of private finance contracts, as well as their elevated returns and interest rates. Government Members may view these arrangements as hire purchase agreements involving the public sector. This Bill could have provided an opportunity to establish a definitive boundary for these companies and to communicate that, rather than continuing to extract excessive funds from our schools and hospitals, they should engage in contract renegotiations. The Bill might have allowed for the introduction of a moratorium or the implementation of a windfall tax, modeled on the banking levy, targeting such companies to recover the disproportionate profits they are evidently gaining from the public sector. These funds could have been allocated more effectively, for example, to support our police services or ensure fair remuneration for public sector employees. However, the absence of such measures in this Bill means that the cost will ultimately be borne by all of us. With the activation of the PF2 contracts, it is apparent that the Government has not incorporated the lessons regarding the expense of public sector borrowing that should have informed this legislation.",Economic

"My third observation concerns legal issues. I take the opportunity to reference the Justice Committee’s ninth report from the 2016-17 parliamentary session of the previous Parliament. As hon.

I trust that a Government response to that report will be forthcoming soon; it remains one of the documents currently awaiting attention—hopefully moving from the Ministry of Justice’s in-tray to its out-tray. Perhaps a discreet reminder could be conveyed by those on the Treasury Bench to their right hon. Friends at the Ministry.

The report is constructive in nature and emphasizes the significance of arrangements for information-sharing within the legal and justice systems. This partly concerns the UK’s legal services, which connects with my earlier remarks regarding the financial services sector in London. The legal services sector supports a substantial portion of that financial work, making it essential to address this matter effectively for UK firms engaging with counterparts in the EU or other third countries. Presently, much of the work is governed by English law, which offers a notable benefit to us, so ensuring proper data-sharing mechanisms in these areas is of great importance to the firms concerned.",Economic

Nevertheless, the Command Paper acknowledges that

“some new administrative process for traders, notably new electronic import declaration requirements, and safety and security information, for goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK”

will be implemented. Could the Minister clarify whether this will encompass rules of origin checks, safety and security inspections, and import declarations, and if so, where and by what means these checks will be conducted?

The protocol was designed to uphold the Good Friday agreement in all aspects, with the east-west relationship being as crucial as the north-south one.

It is not unexpected that, during a constituency-wide Brexit consultation I carried out, Nissan, located within my constituency, was a prominent concern, particularly regarding trade, investment, employment, and skills. The Chancellor had an ideal chance in last week’s Budget to establish a foundation for robust economic growth capable of withstanding potential challenges during the EU negotiations; however, the outcomes fell short of expectations. The skills-related measures announced were insufficient and must be considered within the broader context of the Government’s overall strategy on education and skills development.",Economic

There was significant confusion in the messaging from the opposing side, which now needs to be clarified with accurate information regarding the expected trends in key economic indicators before further decisions proceed.

I assert that we are confronting a hard Brexit, and it is important to review what has been communicated. The Treasury document leaked last November indicated that the UK might face a loss of up to £66 billion from a hard Conservative Brexit, with GDP potentially declining by around 9.5% if the UK were to operate under WTO rules. I acknowledge that this represents a worst-case scenario, but if the conditions leading to such an outcome arise and no contingency plan is in place, responsibility would rest with the Government for inadequate preparation. The critical element here—the scenario of reverting to WTO rules—is essential because the Prime Minister has stated that a poor deal is worse than no deal. This reasoning is somewhat paradoxical, as no deal constitutes the least favourable outcome; it results in an immediate fallback to WTO regulations, with all associated tariffs and regulatory challenges.",Economic

If it is truly crucial to the Americans that we remain members, perhaps they will cover the £18 billion annual membership fee on our behalf.

New clause 7 aims to require the Government to do what is widely supported across the House—specifically, to publish an assessment of the impact of their customs arrangements proposals on businesses. The Government have avoided conducting thorough impact assessments, and have faced criticism when assessments were leaked. They have taken significant measures to prevent such information from becoming public. New clause 7 would mandate that, within six months of the Bill receiving Royal Assent, the Government must provide a detailed account of the economic effects of their proposals on the UK. New clause 8 would oblige them to detail the implications for the Northern Ireland-Ireland border, an issue that still raises concerns. New clause 37 explicitly aims to eliminate any possibility of a withdrawal agreement. Neither the political parties in this House or Northern Ireland, nor the Irish Government, support the establishment of a border in the Irish Sea. Nevertheless, new clause 37 appears intended to remove the framework necessary for discussions concerning backstop arrangements.",Economic

"This Bill primarily serves as a framework. It has the backing of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and provides greater opportunities for action within the House of Commons and the devolved Administrations. The legislation and the proposals presented by this UK Conservative Government acknowledge devolution. They aim to promote sustainability both in our marine environments and in fishing communities. For many years—spanning decades—fishing communities in Moray, including Cullen, Findochty, Buckie, and Burghead, have experienced declines in fishing opportunities nationwide due to the constraints imposed by the common fisheries policy. This policy has significantly impacted industries vital to numerous towns and villages across the country. Several of these communities have faced severe challenges, but current measures offer a chance to restore the fishing sector: to rebuild the industry, the fleet, the workforce, and the catches, thereby supporting local communities as they were supported in previous decades. This revitalisation is expected to occur as a result of the legislation currently being considered, debated, and advanced by this UK Government and Parliament.",Human Impact

"The Government will likely argue that the effects on the creative sectors and individuals’ capacity to obtain visas for work-related travel, supported by an effective immigration system, will be governed by reciprocal agreements with the EU.

"Lastly, new clause 18 addresses migration figures. The political declaration confirms the intention to end free movement. This presents a considerable challenge, which the SNP has opposed at every opportunity. While we do not support leaving the EU, if the UK is resolved to exit and establish its own immigration system, it requires one without a £30,000 salary threshold and one that permits individuals to live and work in Scotland. Should the UK Government be unwilling to implement this, they ought to transfer those powers to Scotland to enable such policy, or alternatively, Scotland should have the option to pursue independence again to establish a more suitable immigration framework.

The demographic profile of Scotland is ageing more rapidly than that of the rest of the UK. Within the UK, 15% of the agriculture and food industry workforce consists of EU nationals.

"Regarding social care and our hospitals, I acknowledge the modest additional funding included in the Budget. However, many Members continue to face local challenges, as I do as well. Currently, hospital beds are available in both Honiton and Seaton, but there is a plan to remove these beds from both locations. This would result in an area of around 100 square miles without any hospital beds. The health service management must take into account the size of Devon and the distances patients and visitors must travel to reach a hospital.

"I will keep my remarks concise as we approach a significant phase in the proceedings.

The margin of 48% to 52% was relatively narrow, but in Coventry specifically, the vote was 40% to remain and 60% to leave.

Regarding the invocation of Article 50 in this House, I held little doubt—indeed, I would not consider opposing a clearly democratic decision—that it was necessary to proceed, which we did. Nevertheless, I also expressed two conditions I believed crucial to mitigate the more adverse consequences of Brexit: the implementation of a transitional period for the new arrangements, and that these arrangements be as flexible as possible.

"To conclude, I wish to address the announcements made concerning the Budget over the past week. These include the decision to implement additional departmental spending reductions and changes to personal independence payments alongside other welfare-related measures. It is believed that the latter highlights the effect of the welfare cap in restricting support for the most vulnerable while aiming to balance public finances, reinforcing earlier forecasts that the UK may experience increased inequality not seen since the era of Margaret Thatcher. This also suggests that the Government has not altered its approach, adjusting figures to align with its ideological stance driven by austerity policies, and not acknowledging that reducing spending alone does not lead to economic growth.

Fundamentally, the significant issue with this Budget, presented only shortly before the invocation of article 50, is that Brexit was notably absent from discussion, leaving the country ill-prepared for the substantial economic challenges that may arise under this Government’s actions.",Human Impact
"In conclusion, I wish to address the announcements made regarding the Budget over the last week. These included the decision to implement additional cuts to departmental spending, as well as changes to personal independence payments and other welfare policies. The latter, in our view, illustrates the tangible effects of the welfare cap, which places a burden on the most vulnerable while aiming to balance the budget, supporting forecasts that the UK may experience increased inequality not seen since the era of Margaret Thatcher. It also indicates that this Government’s approach remains unchanged. They are adjusting figures to align with their ideological stance, guided by an austerity policy, without acknowledging that reducing spending alone cannot drive economic growth. Fundamentally, the most significant aspect of this Budget, issued just weeks before the triggering of article 50, is that Brexit was notably absent from direct mention, and the nation is inadequately prepared for the substantial economic challenges anticipated under this Government’s course.",Human Impact

As is well known, this represents the most severe form of Brexit, with reductions and outcomes beyond current anticipation—and for what purpose? If this were being undertaken to achieve a noble goal, such as tackling global poverty or addressing significant injustices worldwide, it might be somewhat understandable. However, the reality is that this course is driven by the UK’s stance on immigration. This is the central, underlying motivation behind our exit from the EU and takes priority over all other factors. All other issues are secondary consequences. We live in a highly connected, globalised environment where the movement of people is unprecedented, whether they are fleeing persecution or sharing knowledge and skills. Yet, we are expected to accept the notion that a Brexit-altered UK can resist this global flow, akin to a modern-day Canute. I found it quite amusing to hear the rhetoric about a “global UK.” In truth, the Conservatives are not aiming for a global UK—they are seeking a UK that resembles a closed, isolated fortress.",Moral Value

As we understand, this represents the most stringent form of Brexit, with reductions and effects that are currently unforeseeable—and for what reason? If this were undertaken for a significant ideal or major cause, such as tackling global poverty or addressing substantial injustices worldwide, it might be somewhat justifiable. However, the reality is that the UK is pursuing this course primarily due to concerns about immigration. This core issue drives all aspects of our exit from the EU and takes priority above all else, with other factors being secondary. We must acknowledge that we inhabit a connected, globalised environment where the movement of people is extensive—often due to escaping persecution or exchanging skills and ideas.

"Following my Adjournment debate on 11 February, and ahead of today’s ten-minute rule Bill, the commission has finally issued guidance with illustrative examples regarding the contentious issue of notional spending. This undated guidance accompanied a letter addressed to me dated 8 March. According to the new guidance, unauthorised expenditure is considered an election expense for reporting purposes if there has been active involvement in the spending activity, meeting the “made use of” criterion. It is problematic that an individual’s freedom, reputation, and livelihood could be jeopardised based solely on three words and a potential prosecutor’s interpretation of whether a candidate was aware of an unauthorised activity.",Moral Value

"The key issue highlighted in the article by Professor Bogdanor, which the Brexit Secretary has extensively cited, is that while the amendment is a necessary measure, it alone is not adequate, because Parliament cannot overturn the decision made by the public in a referendum. The article clearly states this point, as do the Liberal Democrats, although our perspective differs from some Brexit supporters on the Government Benches. We hold the view that after Parliament has examined the final agreement or the lack thereof, the ultimate decision should rest with the public. This is a standard principle. In countries governed by plebiscites, such as Switzerland, confirmatory referendums are routine. The populace votes initially, then the legislature and Executive consider the issue, followed by a confirmatory referendum to establish whether the public endorses the proposal.

"I anticipate that today’s discussion will involve considerable examination of the effectiveness of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The Minister has clearly expressed the view that the Act was unsuccessful, but I maintain that there is a valid counterpoint suggesting that certain elements functioned as intended, although it was certainly accompanied by some shortcomings and challenges. A notable instance is the 2015 general election, which occurred five years after the 2010 general election, demonstrating the Act’s role in maintaining the coalition Government’s schedule. Additionally, one could argue that the 2017 general election further illustrates the Act’s operation, as it included provisions for calling an early election, which were utilized on that occasion.

The core of the debate regarding the Act’s effectiveness likely revolves around the functioning of the Parliament between 2017 and 2019, which arguably exposes some of the Act’s weaknesses. One significant issue was the provision allowing the Prime Minister to influence the timing of elections, which, from my perspective, was a key point of contention. At that time, the Opposition was concerned that the Prime Minister might misuse the Act to facilitate a no-deal departure from the European Union. Hence, it is clear that the Act was not without its imperfections.",None

"This Bill represents a modestly significant milestone. It marks the initial application of the European Union Act 2011, which was designed to balance the Liberal Democrats' desire to maximise the advantages of EU membership with the Conservatives' insistence on thorough parliamentary examination and, if required, legislation or a referendum before any transfer of powers from the UK to the EU level. In this instance, no referendum is required, as the Bill solely facilitates the approval of an intergovernmental treaty involving other EU member states.

According to these arrangements, charges on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should only apply if the goods are destined for the EU single market or if there is a significant and clear risk that they might be.",None
"The Government has consistently stated its intention to ensure unrestricted access for businesses in Northern Ireland to the broader UK internal market. At the same time, it remains equally committed to fulfilling its obligations to the people of Northern Ireland as outlined in the Northern Ireland protocol, as well as safeguarding the advances achieved through the Belfast Good Friday agreement. This Bill aims to reinforce those commitments by establishing legal clarity concerning the customs, VAT, and excise frameworks in Northern Ireland following the conclusion of the transition period.

To begin, I would like to address the customs provisions within the Bill. Members will be aware that the UK functions as a single customs territory, a principle explicitly affirmed by article 4 of the Northern Ireland protocol. Nevertheless, the protocol mandates the implementation of a novel and specific set of procedures governing the movement of goods from Great Britain to Northern Ireland. According to these procedures, charges on goods transferred between Great Britain and Northern Ireland should only apply when such goods are intended for the EU single market or when there is a significant and demonstrable risk that they might enter that market.",None

"Why is the UK Government not taking greater action to advance wave and tidal energy projects to a level where they can be expanded? This represents a significant opportunity for Scotland to take a leading role internationally. However, current UK Government policies and procurement procedures impose limitations.

This situation further indicates that Westminster’s approach does not align with Scotland’s interests.

What plans does Westminster have to increase the production and installation of heat pumps to the 600,000 units annually outlined in the 10-point plan? At present, only around 20,000 units are installed each year. When will Westminster develop a comprehensive strategy for energy efficiency?

"Why has the UK Government not taken more action to advance wave and tidal energy projects to a stage suitable for expansion? This represents an area where Scotland has the potential to be a global leader. However, current UK Government policies and procurement procedures impose limitations. Opportunities for green employment in manufacturing and fabrication sectors have already been lost due to shortcomings in the Contracts for Difference (CfD) process related to offshore wind procurement. This situation further indicates challenges in how Westminster’s approach aligns with Scotland’s interests.

What plans does Westminster have for increasing heat pump production and installation to the 600,000 annual units outlined in the 10-point plan? Presently, only about 20,000 installations occur each year. When will Westminster establish a comprehensive strategy for energy efficiency? The approach needs to reflect the priority given to national infrastructure projects, similar to the Scottish Government’s methodology. The Scottish Government’s per capita expenditure on this area is four times higher than that of Westminster, supporting job creation and necessary long-term investments.",Powerlessness

One clear takeaway from the covid pandemic should be that excessive centralisation by this Government is ineffective.

Contemporary governance must prioritize consultation and collaboration rather than imposing directives from above.

Gentleman, like myself and every other Member in the House, understands that delegating powers through secondary legislation concentrates authority in the hands of Ministers and does not undergo the same level of scrutiny. Additionally, this matter is not solely about the concentration of power under clause 9; it also pertains to the procedure the Government intend to use to make decisions regarding the withdrawal agreement that would activate clause 9.",Powerlessness
"The hon. Member has consistently supported the duties and authorities of Parliament, yet he quickly diverges into discussing the longstanding nature of our relationship with the EU. The central matter here concerns how that relationship will evolve. We understand that changes are imminent following the referendum and the article 50 negotiations, but it is the responsibility of all Members to decide the manner of these changes. The hon. Member is fully aware, as am I and all others in this Chamber, that delegating powers via secondary legislation results in the concentration of authority in Ministers’ hands and reduces the level of parliamentary scrutiny. Moreover, the issue extends beyond the concentration of powers under clause 9; it also involves the procedure the Government propose to adopt for making decisions on the withdrawal agreement that would activate clause 9.",Powerlessness
"It is essential to prevent the disorder that would result from such inconsistencies. For this reason, I do not support the proposed amendments to clause 10 and schedule 2 that aim to expand the delegated powers of the devolved Administrations. The Bill does not represent a transfer of power but rather a practical approach. Nonetheless, it is crucial that the devolved Administrations are granted suitable delegated powers to amend legislation so it remains effective following Brexit. The primary objective of the Bill is to maintain the statute book and reduce disruption.

Granting delegated powers to the devolved Administrations follows naturally from our devolution arrangements and the reality that, similar to Westminster, the necessary adjustments in Holyrood, Cardiff Bay, and eventually Stormont cannot be accomplished solely through primary legislation. As the Minister highlighted, it is vital for the devolved Administrations to have sufficiently broad powers to implement appropriate modifications, rather than being limited to minimal changes that leave the statute book functioning inadequately. Our goal is a statute book that operates fully after Brexit, not one that functions only to a limited extent.",Powerlessness

"I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. It is important to have this matter clearly recorded during the debate for the House’s consideration, as we are addressing issues that may set precedents with far-reaching consequences extending well beyond the immediate timeframe and beyond the question of whether we leave in line with the preferences expressed by the British public.

My final point, which is perhaps even more pertinent to this specific proposal, concerns the established convention that the Crown prerogative is vested in the Government. The Prime Minister and Ministers represent the Crown in all international negotiations. This is not solely our perspective within this House; as long as we remain subject to the higher authority of Brussels, it is also the legal framework of Brussels. The European Union authorities do not wish to engage in discussions with groups of Members of Parliament. Their negotiations are conducted with the UK Government, as it is the Government that is the signatory to the treaty and the party seeking the EU’s agreement to our withdrawal—or alternatively, the Government responsible for the automatic withdrawal under article 50 should no agreement be reached.",Powerlessness

The third and final point I wish to raise is particularly pertinent to this specific proposal: it is customary that the Government hold the Crown prerogative, with the Prime Minister and Ministers acting on behalf of the Crown in all international negotiations. This is not only the perspective held within this House of Commons, important though that is; as long as we remain subject to the higher authority of Brussels law, it is also the law established by Brussels. The Brussels institutions—the European Union—do not seek to engage in negotiations with groups of Members of Parliament.

"Indeed. It is remarkable that, considering our strong fishing industry and our proud heritage as an island nation, with much of our history and current identity linked to our fishing fleets, the fishing Minister has already been restricted by his own civil servants and is unable to discuss this matter at all.

It appears that the Government will not conduct any independent assessment over the coming four months regarding the implications for fishing of leaving the EU. Presumably, at some point, a Minister will present a statement—potentially an exaggerated one—and there will be no opportunity for challenge, because the fishing Minister has been sidelined, effectively instructed to remain silent.

"Like several other honourable Members who have contributed this evening and on previous occasions, the Liberal Democrats are in agreement with the general principles of the Bill. Given the current geopolitical instability and the rise of global trade, it is prudent to include measures enabling the Secretary of State to intervene in business transactions that might impact national security. Nonetheless, it is essential that the Bill’s scope is precisely defined to ensure it captures transactions that genuinely pose risks while not imposing unnecessary restrictions on those that should proceed without hindrance.

The issues raised concerning the Bill primarily relate to the broadness of many of its definitions and the ease with which the Secretary of State’s powers to review transactions can be activated. This broad scope generates uncertainty for investors because a wide range of activities could fall under the Secretary of State’s jurisdiction. Such uncertainty may discourage investment at a critical time when the UK is seeking to establish new trade agreements with international partners to compensate for the trade lost following departure from the European Union.",Economic

"I propose the motion,

That the draft Ecodesign for Energy-Related Products and Energy Information (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2020, which were presented to this House on 13 October, be approved.

In recent years, the EU has established a series of product-specific regulations through the ecodesign directive and the energy-labelling framework regulation. Ecodesign regulations focus on reducing both the cost and environmental impact of products used in homes and businesses by setting minimum energy performance requirements. Energy labelling regulations give consumers information about the energy efficiency of products to help them make informed purchasing choices. In 2020, these policies are expected to save households around £100 annually on energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 8 million tonnes of CO2, and encourage innovation and competitiveness within the business sector.

The purpose of this statutory instrument is relatively clear. It modifies retained EU legislation to ensure that the ecodesign and energy labelling framework continues to function effectively in the UK after the transition period concludes at the end of this year. The instrument also applies the Northern Ireland protocol and guarantees unrestricted access for ecodesign and energy labelling policies.",Economic

"I am glad to follow the hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond).

I express my gratitude to the Backbench Business Committee and the three sponsors of today’s debate for bringing this matter before the House. The financial services sector in the UK represents a significant and highly regarded asset. Within the OECD countries, the UK’s financial sector ranks third in terms of economic output. According to recent assessments, London’s financial market is ranked as the second most competitive globally, closely following New York. Consequently, it is expected that London dominates within the UK itself, holding the majority share of sector achievements. The city accounts for 50% of the sector’s economic output nationally; however, Scotland follows closely behind London and the south-east, maintaining a well-established position as a financial centre. Thus, while London occupies a prominent role, the contributions from other regions of the UK are also noteworthy.",Economic
"My right hon. Friend is entirely correct. A longstanding issue within the NHS has been the absence of a comprehensive, long-term workforce strategy. Regardless of differing opinions on the Brexit discussion, it was always misguided to assume that we could avoid training sufficient personnel by relying on recruitment from other EU member states. In reality, we are not unique in facing an ageing population; countries such as France, Spain, and Portugal also require their healthcare professionals, as do, as he accurately notes, less affluent nations.",Economic

Last week, I visited Singapore to formalize our new digital economy agreement, which stands as the most advanced trade deal we have ever concluded. The digital sector contributes £150 billion to the economy and boosts wages, with employees earning approximately 50% above the UK average. This agreement links the UK to the fastest-expanding economies in the Asia-Pacific region and supports our efforts to join Singapore and ten other countries in the trans-Pacific partnership.

"If the Government acknowledges that there is a security issue at both locations, it should provide support for security enhancements at each site.

I recognize that the Government is currently attempting to address the issue, primarily by focusing on improving fencing and security measures. However, my position, which is shared by my colleague, is that it is also necessary to address the underlying factors that attract this migration.

The matter of illegal migration into the country is significant from a public policy perspective. Some may argue that increased immigration is beneficial, suggesting that these individuals offer low-cost labour and other advantages. My view is that the easy access to inexpensive labour diminishes the incentive for employers to modernise their operations, and for an extended period, Governments have depended on open borders and low wages to sustain the economy. The challenge with substantial migration—particularly illegal migration—is that it is not sustainable over the long term in relation to economic stability, public policy, and public sentiment.",Economic
"Regarding trade agreements and our connection with Europe, it has been noted that 60% of our trade occurs with the EU. Whether manufacturing lamb, steel, vehicles, or aerospace components, seamless trade is critically important. While the Prime Minister emphasizes, “Everything will be fine in the end. It’s about our sovereignty,” the issue extends beyond sovereignty; it concerns people’s employment, means of living, and prospects. Those who voted to leave the EU did not intend to forfeit their jobs.

In conclusion, I find some reassurance, albeit limited, that the Secretary of State continues to express positive remarks about the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project and the similar initiative in north Wales. Climate change is severely impacting us. It is understood that to prevent irreversible climate damage, 80% of fossil fuel reserves must remain unused. Additionally, the current low oil prices reflect oversupply and fracking activities, which release significant amounts of methane, exacerbating climate change. Fossil fuel companies are holding assets that may become obsolete, and financial markets are expected to gradually withdraw from this sector. Therefore, it is essential to invest now in environmentally sustainable energy projects compatible with climate goals, such as the Swansea Bay tidal lagoon.",Economic

The protocol was designed to safeguard the Good Friday Agreement in all its aspects, with the east-west relationship being as crucial as the north-south connection.

Investments across Wales include £1.5 billion for rail infrastructure, £120 million for the north Wales growth deal, and £5 million for connected communities. Additionally, the Welsh Government obtained £2.8 billion via the Barnett formula from the UK Government to aid individuals, businesses, and public services during the COVID-19 pandemic. Over 316,000 jobs in Wales were furloughed, and financial support was provided to 100,000 self-employed individuals.

"I have a proposal that will incur no expense to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Once the EU referendum campaign concludes and, as we hope, the nation is persuaded that remaining in the EU is advantageous, I would expect to hear Ministers—some of whom have recently expressed support for EU membership—more frequently discussing the benefits of our participation in the Union. The challenge over the coming four months is that several Ministers, who now correctly acknowledge that overall we are better off within the EU, have not previously emphasized some of the positive aspects involved. Encouraging Ministers to speak more favorably about the EU would not require any additional funding from the FCO.

Regarding Syria, it would be useful to understand precisely what provisions have been made in the budget for the period following the anticipated ceasefire. Should the ceasefire hold and some level of stability be achieved in Syria, it is evident that the FCO will need to allocate significant financial resources to increased engagement in the subsequent stabilisation efforts.

We continue to be assured that all involved parties fully support Hinkley Point C and are diligently working towards a definitive investment decision. EDF and the French Government—EDF’s principal shareholder—have provided assurances to this effect.

In contrast, similar measures have not yet been introduced in Wales. Differences also exist in areas such as public sector pay. The Scottish Government has removed the cap on pay increases for public sector employees, resulting in, for example, a 3% salary increase for a nurse earning £30,000 in the upcoming financial year. This approach differs from that of the Welsh Government, which maintains that additional funding from Westminster is necessary before implementing comparable pay rises.",Economic

The choice to revise the ATOL scheme in order to enhance protection for travellers on holiday, and to bring it in line with improvements to both the EU and UK travel package regulations that existed before the widespread use of online booking, is certainly a positive step. It is essential to update the UK’s financial protection framework for holidaymakers to ensure public safeguarding. Keeping up with developments in the online travel sector and guaranteeing suitable protections are in place, whether consumers book online or through traditional high street outlets, is crucial. Additionally, the Bill aims to facilitate UK businesses selling holidays across Europe by allowing them to operate under the UK’s ATOL scheme rather than multiple national regimes. The provisions contained within this Bill are significant as they seek to address new digital business practices and contemporary consumer purchasing patterns.",Economic
"The agri-food sector in my constituency has experienced significant expansion. Examples include companies such as Willowbrook Foods, Mash Direct, and Pritchitts, which is also known as Lakeland Dairies. This company operates three factories—two located in the Republic and one in Northern Ireland—and exemplifies the need for a soft border transition. Their production process requires milk to cross the border on three occasions: initially as a liquid, then returning as powdered milk, and finally coming back to Newtownards for packaging and processing before distribution worldwide. Another successful agri-food enterprise in my area is Rich Sauces. It is important to recognize that this sector’s success involves not only the factory workers engaged in production and manufacturing but also the farmers supplying milk and those providing arable products for vegetable companies. These are the positive examples, and it is essential to establish an appropriate arrangement to support them.",Economic
"I was about to address the topic of food, and I will do so now as prompted. The United Kingdom currently experiences a substantial annual trade deficit in food with the European Union, amounting to £20 billion. Food products imported without tariffs compete effectively against certain sectors within our domestic farming industry. I urge the Government to adopt a tariff framework on food that lowers tariffs overall for imports from the rest of the world, while applying some tariffs to EU-produced goods to encourage increased domestic production. My aim is to reduce food miles and to see a greater proportion of food both produced and sold within the UK. Since joining the European Union in 1972, the share of the domestic market held by UK-produced food has significantly declined—from over 90% at the time of entry to well below 70% currently. There is no clear reason why the domestic market share cannot be restored.",Economic

"Allow me to address the matters the Chancellor faced. It is difficult to dispute that the Government followed an appropriate course of action. In my opinion, they had no alternative. Upon deciding to shut down the economy, it was necessary to continue supporting workers, companies, and businesses. Consequently, more than £400 billion has been allocated for this purpose. As a Unionist, I often remind people in Northern Ireland that the financial assistance provided to businesses, ongoing furlough payments to employees, support for the self-employed, and similar measures are possible because we are part of the fifth largest economy globally. Without the backing of the UK Treasury, navigating this situation would have been unfeasible. Additionally, the health service has benefited from the vaccination programme. In this regard, the Government’s decisions have been appropriate, and those advocating for independence, regardless of their emotional connections to the UK, should consider the economic advantages of remaining within the United Kingdom.",Economic
"A White Paper on industrial strategy and international trade ought to have been produced together, given the close connection between trade, employment, and economic development. This raises concerns among Labour Members that the Government has not adequately evaluated the risks that future trade agreements might pose to jobs and wage levels. The Government appears to have reversed the proper order of priorities. A trade White Paper should clearly outline the UK’s forthcoming approach to trade defence mechanisms. At present, the EU implements various trade defence tools, including anti-dumping measures targeting China—and to a lesser extent, India and Malaysia—on products such as steel, other metals, and solar panels. The UK has historically opposed these measures within the EU. Now that the UK will determine its own trade policies, the Government must clarify whether it intends to maintain that opposition. Should the Government decide against implementing trade defence measures, it should explain how it will safeguard and support vulnerable industries like steel and solar panels from the impact of inexpensive imports.",Economic
"In my view, this specifically involves managing the framework for the financial services industry, which is essential to my local economy and to the entire UK economy. Financial services account for approximately 11% of the national economic output. Since our economy is composed of around 80% services, it is crucial to address this correctly. Additionally, around 36% of the people I represent are employed in financial and professional services. The financial services sector as a whole generates roughly £72 billion in tax income.",Economic
"Numerous points were raised, which is the essence of my argument. Some may contend that participation in the EEA or membership in EFTA provides not only access to but also inclusion within the single market—although one might prefer to describe it simply as access. There was significant confusion in the messaging from the opposing side, which must now be addressed by providing clear information on the projected path of key economic indicators before any further decisions are made.

I state that we are confronting a hard Brexit, and it is important to consider the information presented. The Treasury document leaked last November indicated that the UK could face losses of up to £66 billion as a result of a hard Conservative Brexit, with GDP potentially declining by approximately 9.5% if the UK were to operate under WTO rules. While I acknowledge that this represents a worst-case scenario, if such conditions arise and no contingency plan is in place, responsibility would rest with the Government for inadequate preparation. The critical aspect of this scenario—the “if we revert to WTO rules”—must be noted, as the Prime Minister has asserted that a poor agreement is preferable to no agreement. This reasoning is problematic, since no agreement effectively constitutes the worst possible outcome, leading to an immediate return to WTO rules along with all associated tariffs and regulatory challenges.",Economic
"What are the prospects moving forward? It is the responsibility of my esteemed colleague Lord Frost and his negotiation team to secure a favourable trade agreement for the United Kingdom, and that is their current objective. Given that the volume of trade in construction products clearly benefits the European Union—approximately £10.8 billion compared to just over £4 billion in the opposite direction—it is in the EU’s interest to establish a solid trade deal with the United Kingdom to maintain the flow of this trade.

The Government considers that the regulations presented to the House are necessary to guarantee the continuation of an effective legislative and regulatory framework for construction products once the transition period ends, and that this framework aligns with the commitments outlined in the critical Northern Ireland protocol. I believe I have addressed all, or nearly all, of the queries raised by Members from across the House. If any remain unanswered, I am willing to respond in writing. With that, I conclude and put forward the draft amendments for the House’s approval.

The hon. Member mentioned a briefing published in the weekend press, which he described as seemingly well-informed regarding our intentions. I find it surprising that he feels compelled to accept all newspaper reports as accurate; I would have thought that such an approach could lead to considerable dissatisfaction, so I recommend that he refrain from doing so. To clarify, our proposals for a British Bill of Rights remain consistent. Our objective is to repeal the Human Rights Act and introduce a British Bill of Rights in its place.

Additionally, chemicals represent our second-largest export, and reports indicate that 20% of chemical manufacturers are either moving operations to Ireland or considering such a move.

It has been suggested that if trade with the EU declines, alternative opportunities could be pursued in emerging markets. However, these markets typically require exchanges involving migration and visa arrangements, similar to the compromises seen with the EU concerning migration and regulatory intervention, which means there is no clear overall gain.

Friend the Member for York Central (Rachael Maskell) mentioned earlier, this is a minor matter since it does not involve a substantial amount of money.

This agreement aims to protect employment, preserve the Union, and prevent a hard border between Northern Ireland and Ireland. In response, the right hon. Gentleman has expressed conflicting positions: he advocates for new trade agreements but also supports remaining in the customs union. When questioned about free movement, he stated that Labour is not committed to freedom of movement for EU citizens as a principle, yet does not exclude it either.

Therefore, he appears unable to maintain a consistent stance on his own policies.",Economic
"Brexit represents just one element of the Department for International Trade’s responsibilities, and I commend my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Trade for his efforts to identify and expand trade opportunities globally. Our nation has lagged behind in this area for many years. The international community does not have an obligation to provide for us. If we do not actively promote and sell our goods and services, we risk missing out and failing to generate the necessary wealth for the country. Economic benefits will not come to us passively; we must engage proactively. The proposals outlined in the Queen’s Speech aimed at enhancing our trade outcomes are very much appreciated.",Economic
"The proposed amendment would obligate the Government to assess the effects of clause 1 to confirm that it does not negatively impact UK consumers who use companies based in the EU. In brief, the clause modernizes ATOL—the air travel organisers’ licence—to align it with the 2015 EU package travel directive. This measure broadens the scope of ATOL to cover a wider variety of holidays and offer increased consumer protection. It is understood that UK travel firms will be able to operate more smoothly across Europe, as they will be required to adhere to protections determined by the country where they are established, rather than the country of sale. These are the aims the Government intends to fulfill. There is no fundamental disagreement between the Government and the Opposition on this issue. In fact, it is the package travel directive that has made the inclusion of this provision in the Bill necessary.",Economic
"I am confident that the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), representing the Green party, would strongly oppose my views on fracking if she were present. However, I welcome the inclusion of measures related to it. Fracking appears to be among the more practical options for the future energy supply in Britain, as it is comparatively cleaner and more environmentally considerate than other fossil fuels, and it offers significant investment opportunities. I have been informed by a lobbyist that there might be a chance to amend the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, which I sponsored, to support the objectives we are pursuing regarding warm homes.",Economic
"It is acknowledged that businesses generally prefer to avoid uncertainty, and there is clearly some uncertainty in certain aspects of the regulatory and legal frameworks related to financial services. With the House’s permission, I will focus on two such areas. Firstly, as Members will be well aware, one important issue raised concerns this country’s aim to continue accessing the single passport system for financial services within European Union member states. This system allows a firm authorised to conduct a specific activity in one member state to operate in other member states without needing additional authorisation or regulation. It would be helpful to receive clarification from the Minister and the Secretary of State on whether we plan to maintain this arrangement.",Economic
"I believe there is insufficient time to establish a bespoke free trade agreement that surpasses our existing one. We will either retain the current framework, adjusted for WTO compliance, once we exit the Union, or we will not. In the event that we do not, trading will proceed under WTO rules once we operate outside the EU’s customs and tariff system. We are fully aware of this scenario, as it reflects our current trade practices with non-EU countries while being members of the EU.",Economic
"There is potential progress to be made with New Zealand, and once negotiations with TTIP conclude, there may be opportunities to engage with the United States under President Trump, although challenges are expected in both cases. Securing an agreement with New Zealand is essential, as they are among our closest allies on trade matters, maintain effective governance, have a positive stance towards us, and align with our free trade principles. However, their initial requirement will likely involve the removal of quotas and tariffs on lamb, which could present difficulties for our already struggling agricultural industry. It will be important to approach this issue with caution.

Any American Administration, should we manage to make progress despite the current protectionist and isolationist stance, will likely insist on market access for their beef. While I personally do not object to hormone-treated beef, negotiations will need to be robust regarding the extent to which we open our market to American products, particularly as they seek to offload heavily subsidised agricultural goods. Given our current position, we may not be viewed as strong negotiating partners. I will not elaborate further, but it is clear that exiting the customs union has its constraints.",Economic
I am pleased that this debate is taking place. My hon. Friend might be familiar with research conducted by Revo and intu shopping centres examining the attractiveness of the UK retail sector to international investors. The findings indicated that business rates represent the primary obstacle to new international inward investment.

"In Wales, governed by Labour, the Government has allocated funds to areas of greatest necessity rather than providing council tax relief to large food retailers that are generating substantial profits, nor offering stamp duty reductions for those purchasing second homes for holiday purposes. Instead, a £2 billion resilience fund has been established, and the Development Bank of Wales is investing in small enterprises to protect 141,000 jobs. This represents effective devolution, though appropriate resources are required to fulfill these responsibilities. Currently, only 2% of rail investment funding is directed to serve 5% of the population. There is a need for a high-speed rail connection linking Bristol, Cardiff, Swansea, and west Wales to enhance Union connectivity. Additionally, the shared prosperity fund should be allocated to, for, and by Wales. The promised Swansea Bay tidal lagoon project and the electrification of railways remain necessary. Despite these needs, Wales is not receiving a proportionate share of investment, a matter that was not addressed in the Budget.",Economic

"In addition to challenges facing public finances, household financial situations are also under strain. Factors such as increasing interest rates, elevated inflation, slower wage growth, and the freeze on working-age benefits are likely to create difficulties for typical households. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor has outlined two key principles guiding Conservative-led Governments: firstly, that employment should be rewarding; and secondly, that individuals ought to retain a greater portion of their earnings. I, along with other Conservative Members, am pleased to endorse these principles.

The financial challenges experienced by households—currently under examination by the Committee as part of our investigation into household finances—will become more severe, especially for younger people, if longstanding issues in the housing market are not addressed, as highlighted by my right hon. Friend. Therefore, I welcome the housing-related measures announced. He has introduced a wide-ranging plan involving skills development, increasing land availability, and financial incentives aimed at boosting housing construction in Britain. I also appreciate the upcoming review to be led by my right hon. Friend the Member for West Dorset (Sir Oliver Letwin). His involvement is often a sign of the seriousness of the issue. This review will investigate the discrepancy between the number of planning permissions granted and the houses actually built, as well as the reasons for that gap.",Economic

The draft airports national policy statement provides a comprehensive explanation of this reasoning. Heathrow is anticipated to deliver the largest economic and employment advantages, creating tens of thousands of new local jobs by 2030 and generating up to £61 billion in economic benefits, excluding broader trade gains. The project is expected to benefit the entire United Kingdom. I anticipate that Heathrow airport will collaborate with airlines to enhance domestic connectivity, including introducing six additional domestic routes across the UK by 2030, increasing the total to 14. This will reinforce current connections to nations and regions and establish new links.",Economic
"Beginning with the steel industry, it is evident that the last twenty years have presented significant difficulties for this sector. Most recently, the industry faced a crisis in 2015 due to a combination of excess global production—exacerbated by Chinese steel dumping—and elevated domestic industrial energy costs. Despite these challenges, steel continues to be a fundamental and enabling part of the broader economy. According to a Government report on the future prospects of the industry, there is an estimated potential increase in steel demand valued at £3.8 billion by 2030. Achieving this growth largely relies on maintaining a robust trade remedies framework, which brings the discussion back to the current Bill.",Economic

Friend the Member for Glasgow North West (Carol Monaghan) have not been addressed, nor has there been any justification offered for the characterization of the procurement process as being driven by medicinal considerations. Furthermore, there has been no clear rationale or explanation for seeking an exemption from competitive tendering under regulation 32 concerning unforeseeable circumstances, and the detailed inquiries made by my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Edinburgh South West (Joanna Cherry) remain unanswered.",Economic
"As we carry out the decision made by the British public to exit the EU by the end of March 2019, we seek to establish a close and distinctive partnership with the European Union. In our future partnership document published last summer, the Government presented two possible customs arrangements designed to best achieve these goals. The first option involves a highly efficient customs system, incorporating various measures to reduce trade barriers, including maintaining certain existing trade facilitation agreements and implementing new technology-driven solutions. The second option proposes a new customs partnership, an innovative and unprecedented method whereby the UK would align with the EU’s import requirements for goods entering the EU from third countries, thereby eliminating the necessity for a formal customs border between the UK and the EU. These proposals were further elaborated in the Government’s White Paper released last October, as well as in the Prime Minister’s Mansion House address and her subsequent statement to the House. We anticipate engaging in discussions about both options with our European counterparts and with businesses in the UK and EU as negotiations move forward.",Economic

I do not question that it aligns with American interests for us to continue our membership in the EU, as we bring a measure of pragmatism and the US may be concerned about increasing influence from the French, who tend to be less favorable towards America. If the US places such importance on our EU membership, perhaps they might consider covering the £18 billion annual membership cost on our behalf. I await an offer to that effect from President Obama during his visit to support the referendum campaign. Undoubtedly, that sum would be relatively minor from the perspective of the United States.",Economic
"The Prime Minister urges members to vote against the proposal—effectively supporting a no-deal outcome. As my wife often tells our children, “If you have nothing constructive to contribute, it is usually better to remain silent.”

This scenario highlights the core issue that has consistently underpinned the negotiations. Maintaining a level playing field ensures there are no tariffs or quotas; however, deviating from this principle will result in costs being shouldered by British businesses, workers, and consumers. The Prime Minister has not avoided this challenge; the agreement he has reached incorporates this reality. This presents a key question for future Governments and Parliaments: should they build upon this agreement to guarantee that the UK upholds high standards and that businesses can trade with the EU market as freely as possible with minimal disruption; or should they opt to reduce standards and protections, thereby creating additional obstacles for trade with our closest and most significant partners?",Economic
"I wish to address the importance of enhancing skills and employment opportunities within our nation, particularly in the manufacturing sector, in light of last week’s Budget. This issue is especially relevant as we embark on the process of exiting the EU.

It is unsurprising that, during a Brexit consultation exercise conducted across my constituency, Nissan, which operates locally, was a prominent topic, notably regarding trade, investment, employment, and skills. The Chancellor’s Budget last week presented an ideal chance to establish a foundation for robust economic growth capable of withstanding potential challenges during the EU departure negotiations; however, the outcome was disappointing. The measures announced concerning skills were insufficient and must be considered within the broader context of the Government’s overall education and skills strategy.",Economic
"The effects on automobile manufacturers have not been adequately addressed. This matter extends beyond simply opening new international trade opportunities; it concerns a supply chain that is intricately integrated across Europe. For example, a standard drive shaft for a family sedan is produced in six different European countries. What options will car manufacturers have if tariffs are introduced between the UK and the EU? Just last night, I spoke with a multinational retailer employing 3,000 staff who is relocating to premises that will accommodate 5,000 employees. These individuals move between cities such as London, Frankfurt, and Paris in a similar way to how one might move from North Yorkshire to London, yet they now face the possibility that such movement could be restricted. How have these matters been overlooked in our decision-making process, without addressing these concerns and questions?

There is a broader concern to consider. Observing the European Union during this delicate phase, I perceive it as a fragile structure, and if the UK removes its foundational element, there is a considerable chance that the entire system could collapse. This domestic economic challenge could escalate into an international and global economic issue, accompanied by political and security challenges. The UK’s economy and national security outlook could be significantly impacted.",Economic

The French think-tank, Notre Europe, also known as the Jacques Delors Institute—I will not elaborate as extensively as I did during the Second Reading, since my honourable Friend the Minister is now fully informed about the allocation of funds from this budget line—was founded by the former President of the European Commission and advocates his vision of a European Union as a federation of nation states. During the previous multi-annual financial framework, it received close to £1.87 million from the Europe for Citizens programme.

For 52 years, local residents have effectively paid twice in taxation, and this practice appears likely to continue. It may be appropriate for the Welsh Assembly to examine this particular infrastructure matter. It is concerning that individuals are charged tolls on top of contributing to the national road network funding for Wales and the west of England.

According to the Severn Bridges Act 1992, it was agreed that tolls would be levied for a specified period. This period is due to conclude either later this year or early next year, at which point the Severn bridges should be regarded in the same manner as other motorways throughout the United Kingdom. At that stage, the costs of maintenance ought to be covered by national funds. This forms a clear rationale supporting the removal of the toll charges.",Economic

Cumbria’s most significant internal market is its connection with south-west Scotland. The border between them is very fluid, often unnoticed: individuals may work on one side and reside on the other; attend school on one side and access healthcare on the other. Sheep raised in Cumbria are sold in Scotland, while cattle raised in Scotland are sold in Cumbria. Farmers who rely on shared standards across both areas are now facing the prospect of those standards being compromised.

Last week, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, which I lead, traveled to Newry and engaged with local business representatives. Nowhere else in the United Kingdom will the consequences of Brexit be felt more intensely than in Northern Ireland. However, that region risks being disadvantaged in the negotiations because its perspective may not be represented as strongly as those of the other home nations.

It remains my view that achieving a deal superior to the one currently held within the European Union is unlikely, yet negotiations will proceed and an agreement will be finalized.

The most appropriate and reasonable course is to permit the public—not officials in Whitehall, Brussels, or this Chamber—to decide if the agreement is suitable for them, their families, their employment, and the nation.

Do not worry, we will ensure the delivery of medicines. I have dispatched the Trade Minister to negotiate numerous agreements. Do not worry, everything will be managed.” This scenario arises because, among the various negotiable choices, the Government has selected the one likely to cause the greatest disruption to people's daily lives.

"Earlier this week, the Government released their Environment Bill. While some elements were positive, there was limited information regarding the Government’s seemingly ambitious air quality objectives. If, as the Government frequently asserts, leaving the European Union provides an opportunity to create stronger legislation, why have they not clearly stated that provisions in one of their key Bills will surpass current EU standards? Why have they not utilized this chance to achieve the more stringent guidelines established by the WHO? Why does the proposed new regulatory body appear to reduce enforcement tools such as fines aimed at ensuring compliance with these targets? The Government should not transfer responsibility to local authorities while simultaneously reducing their funding to avoid making challenging decisions.

The Government’s progress in enhancing air quality and safeguarding children is insufficient in scope and pace. I have participated in marches, attended, and spoken at several climate change and air quality events within my constituency. This issue is one we feel strongly about. Frequently, it is children—the next generation—who are at the forefront of advocacy for cleaner air. We should take steps to support their efforts.",Human Impact

Additionally, it is necessary to acknowledge, when reviewing the significant advances Northern Ireland is making in economic growth and recovery from the covid pandemic, that the European Union has a valid point regarding the requirement to perform appropriate checks on goods and products moving into and out of the single market—an obligation for which we have a comparable arrangement within the United Kingdom’s own single market.

"I will be backing the Prime Minister’s agreement today because, according to west midlands businesses that employ thousands of my constituents, it is “good enough”—adequate for us to exit the EU and prosper independently. It may not be flawless, but those considering alternative plans should reflect on the challenges faced by industry. This is not the moment to oppose the practical realities presented. I acknowledge my right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for his understanding of this.

At present, businesses require clarity. With only 73 days remaining before we leave the EU, companies are already incurring expenses to stockpile materials and components and, in some cases, to suspend production capacity. These costs impact their profitability and ultimately lead to job losses. The automotive sector, which relies heavily on the EU market, is especially affected. It is important to note that its factories employ workers from some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of the UK. While some colleagues may not have seen job losses in their areas yet, in the west midlands, we certainly have.",Human Impact
"The agreement does not safeguard employment rights, and only a single paragraph in the political declaration addresses the protection of rights and standards, indicating the limited emphasis the Government placed on this issue during negotiations. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) has stated that it cannot endorse an agreement that fails to secure rights at work, employment, and peace in Northern Ireland. It has highlighted the inadequacy of the Political Declaration and noted that it lacks legal enforceability. Workers are left uncertain about the true nature of the UK’s future relationship with the EU and the effects it will have on their lives. The only clear outcome appears to be that this Brexit agreement will reduce the country’s wealth, as reflected in the Government’s own economic forecasts, which predict a GDP decline of approximately 3.9% and negative impacts across all UK regions.",Human Impact
"Secondly, we ought to explicitly connect the living conditions of individuals and the resulting demands they place on local services and housing availability to the allocation of seasonal work permits. I propose that a sponsor, whether a large employer or a properly regulated labour provider, should be required to specify the guaranteed duration of payment for the individual, irrespective of the tasks they perform, and must demonstrate that suitable accommodation will be provided. If implemented correctly, this presents a genuine chance to address certain instances of modern slavery within agricultural labour, an issue the Government has already taken significant steps to combat.

Thirdly, and lastly, I suggest that the sponsorship scheme just mentioned could allow for some degree of influence over regional migration trends. While it is not feasible to establish border controls between areas such as Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire, the scheme might enable improved monitoring and forecasting of local demands on public services, although it should be noted that alterations to free movement policies will have a more substantial impact in this regard.",Human Impact
"In conclusion, I wish to address the announcements related to the Budget made over the past week. These include the decision to implement additional departmental spending reductions and changes to personal independence payments alongside other welfare provisions. The latter, in our view, illustrates the tangible effects of the welfare cap, which impacts the most vulnerable and aims to balance public finances through measures that affect those with lower incomes. This outcome aligns with earlier forecasts that the UK may experience increased inequality reminiscent of the period under Margaret Thatcher, and it further indicates that the Government’s approach remains unchanged. The figures are being adjusted to align with a particular ideological stance centered on austerity, without acknowledgment that reducing spending alone will not drive economic growth. Fundamentally, the key issue with this Budget, issued shortly before the triggering of article 50, is the absence of any direct reference to Brexit. Consequently, the country appears ill-prepared for the significant economic challenges that may arise as a result of this Government’s actions.",Human Impact

"I am reflecting on events from many years ago. [Interruption.] I intend to elaborate on that point. I am not attributing fault to any specific individual except the Home Office—naturally, that will be universally acknowledged—and even then, I am not placing full blame on the Home Office. The issue was largely a matter of lack of awareness. In fact, if we consider the era of what might be termed traditional slavery, it is likely that many would have denied its existence. It was only through the efforts of people like William Wilberforce and others that awareness gradually increased. I must admit that when I first entered Parliament, I was unaware of human trafficking or contemporary forms of slavery, and I certainly did not anticipate becoming involved in addressing the issue.

Along with Anthony Steen and a small group, I traveled extensively across Europe, visiting countries such as Moldova—locations that, to be honest, I had not previously heard of—and discovered the horrific crime of people being trafficked across national borders.

Can the Prime Minister confirm whether the European Council addressed the security consequences of our current position in Europe, especially considering the growing threats posed by Russia, both in military terms and through other recent actions?",Human Impact
"I would like to start by congratulating the hon. Member for Hornchurch and Upminster (Julia Dockerill) on delivering her maiden speech. She conveyed a strong connection to her constituency, which is an excellent foundation for serving effectively as a Member of Parliament. It also reflects the progress made that she is able to state she is only the second woman to represent that area.

This marks my first contribution since the general election, and I wish to begin by expressing my gratitude to my constituents for participating in the vote—particularly those who supported Labour. A majority of my constituents voted to leave the European Union in last year’s referendum, and in conversations with them, they express a desire for a Brexit arrangement that manages immigration while promoting exports and safeguarding long-term employment, especially in the manufacturing sector. They value aspects of the European Union such as the social chapter, the common market—referred to as the customs union—environmental safeguards, collaboration on research and development, and the European arrest warrant.",Human Impact
"Certainly, the former Prime Minister referred to ending the emphasis on safety culture. However, anyone who had been outside Wembley stadium alongside 1,000 workers grieving the loss of a colleague who had recently died in a workplace accident would not speak of ending the safety culture in that way. Additionally, during the Brexit campaign, the Foreign Secretary described employment legislation as excessively burdensome, characterizing it as “back-breaking,” and expressed a preference for eliminating the social charter.

I have no doubt that there are sincerely committed Members on the Conservative side who assure that workers’ rights will be protected; the key issue is determining how those protections will be maintained moving forward.",Human Impact
"For instance, a French national residing in the UK who is married to a British citizen and has children attending school or university here will not have the right to vote in the referendum. Conversely, individuals from the Republic of Ireland, Malta, or Cyprus will be eligible to vote because Malta and Cyprus are members of the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth citizens, along with British citizens, have the right to vote in parliamentary elections. Due to established arrangements with the Republic of Ireland, despite it not being part of the Commonwealth, Irish citizens are entitled to vote in parliamentary elections and to stand for election to Parliament in the UK. The provisions outlined in the Bill result in the exclusion of people who are settled in the UK with families and who maintain a long-term connection to this country from participating in the referendum on whether to separate the UK from their European country, while permitting other non-British individuals to vote in the referendum.",Human Impact
"Universal credit remains a challenge. According to the Children’s Society, despite the additional funding outlined in the Budget, the reduction in work allowances under universal credit, which took effect in April 2016, will result in an annual loss of approximately £2,460 for families. I continue to have concerns about the structure of universal credit, as it is creating numerous practical and frustrating difficulties for many constituents. For instance, one constituent, a single parent working 25 hours a week as a cleaner and caring for a young child in primary school, experienced a change in circumstances and was transferred to universal credit. Due to an error in processing her claim, her initial payment was delayed, leading her to rely on a food bank. Although she received an advance payment, the final settlement of her claim leaves her with insufficient funds to cover living expenses after rent. She is significantly worse off after transitioning from tax credits to universal credit. While some may argue that austerity has ended, issues such as pressures on GP surgeries and challenges related to Brexit and universal credit indicate otherwise.",Human Impact
"We have already heard, and will continue to hear today, about the friends, family members, colleagues, and constituents from other member states who currently face uncertainty regarding their future. Similarly, we have heard, and will hear again, about the valued employees, essential personnel, and crucial public service workers from other EU countries whose future circumstances now appear unclear. It is entirely unacceptable to require individuals to live with such uncertainty. This represents an inappropriate way to treat our EU citizens.

On Monday, the Minister conveyed sincere sympathy towards many of these concerns, and it is evident from his statements that he aims to reach a situation in which EU citizens are able to remain in the country. Nevertheless, expressions of sympathy and hope are insufficient. Clear communication and reassurance are urgently needed, and these can and should be provided.

The reasons given by the Government for declining to offer such clarity are unreasonable and perplexing. On Monday, the Minister expressed displeasure—an attitude he maintains today—regarding the use of phrases like “bargaining chip,” yet he himself acknowledged that securing the status of EU migrants in the UK, alongside that of UK citizens in the EU, “needs to be part of the negotiations.”—[Official Report, 4 July 2016; Vol. 612, c. 616.]",Human Impact
"The Bill ends freedom of movement. With a single action, the rights of individuals in this country will be significantly diminished. Citizens of all ages will no longer have the unrestricted ability to travel abroad, pursue education in other countries, form international friendships, or develop careers internationally. It is likely that the Minister and the Home Secretary, given their ages, will live to see this Bill judged critically by future generations, and this serves as a caution to them now. Many people who have established their lives here, including 3 million neighbours and colleagues, are being clearly signaled that they are not welcome. The standards of Britain should be higher than this.",Human Impact
"Despite numerous assurances from the Scottish Conservative Party to safeguard the interests of our fishermen, it is already evident that the backstop loophole within the agreement poses a significant threat to the Scottish fishing industry. Regarding the proposed arrangement—[Interruption.] It would be beneficial if the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Ross Thomson) paid attention rather than interrupting from the Bar of the House. This matter concerns the livelihoods of fishermen, which the Scottish Conservatives claim to defend. According to the proposed deal, Scottish fish exports destined for the European Union may be subject to harmful tariffs. Any mechanism that allows Scottish vessels registered in Northern Ireland to offload their catch there, subsequently transferring it to the Republic of Ireland for processing to avoid these tariffs, would present substantial risks to Scotland’s fishing harbours and the broader processing sector. This reflects the potential impact on our fishing industry under the current Conservative proposals. Such a scenario would directly endanger thousands of jobs and could render the fishing sector one of the most severely affected by Brexit across Scotland. This is the situation facing Scottish fisheries under Conservative plans. This is the factual situation, contrasting with the rhetoric of the UK Conservative Government, which continues to treat Scotland as a secondary consideration. The Scottish National Party will not accept this outcome.",Human Impact
"This Bill primarily serves as a framework. It has the endorsement of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and enables greater action both within the House of Commons and in the devolved Administrations. The legislation and proposals introduced by this UK Conservative Government acknowledge devolution. They aim to support sustainability not only in our marine environments but also within fishing communities. For many years—spanning decades—fishing communities in Moray, including Cullen, Findochty, Buckie, and Burghead, have experienced declines in fishing activities throughout the country due to the constraints imposed by the common fisheries policy. This policy has had a significant negative impact on industries that were vital to numerous towns and villages nationwide. Several of these areas have faced serious decline, but there is now an opportunity to begin reconstruction: to restore the fishing industry, the fleet, the workforce, and the harvests, as well as their importance to local communities, reflecting their role in past decades. This legislation, currently under consideration and progression by this UK Government and Parliament, offers a pathway to revitalise these regions by reestablishing the fishing sector.",Human Impact
"The Chancellor is aware that West Yorkshire serves as a central hub for the nation’s manufacturing sector.

"The Government state that they are engaged in discussions regarding reciprocal rights. London and Madrid have previously agreed on an arrangement that guarantees voting and employment rights for migrants from each side, although healthcare is excluded from this agreement. Last week, I sent a letter to the Health Secretary and have not received a response. I also approached him in the Lobby to raise this matter, and he indicated that the reciprocal healthcare Bill is currently under consideration in the House of Lords. However, will it have completed the legislative process in both Houses by 30 March?",Human Impact
"I am aware that some Members of this House harbour doubts, and members of the public might also be described as doubtful, but I firmly believe that holding a general election would serve the best interests of the country. As the Prime Minister highlighted in her address yesterday, both the Labour and Conservative parties campaigned on manifestos that accepted the outcome of the referendum. It stands to reason that any Government would be better positioned to renegotiate Brexit if granted a renewed mandate from the electorate to pursue the chosen path. I recognise that many people at home might say, “We have already had two general elections and a referendum in the past four years.” For the people of Scotland, it is two UK-wide general elections, one Scottish parliamentary election, and two referendums within five years. So, while Brenda from Bristol might exclaim, “Not another one,” consider Bernie from Bute’s perspective. Nevertheless, given the severity of the crisis, a Government with a new mandate is required. A general election has the potential to unite people by focusing on the common issues that affect us all—the urgent need to address the challenges in our NHS, our children’s education, and the care of our elderly population.",Human Impact
"As members of the Conservative party, our priority should be ensuring equal opportunities for everyone, promoting regional development to distribute and enhance prosperity and advancement. Therefore, I am especially supportive of the proposed skills for jobs initiative, which acknowledges that half of the population does not attend university and instead promotes ongoing skills development and training to enhance life prospects, particularly as our economy transitions towards a low-carbon future. Expanding access to the student loan system to include all adults over 24 years old could significantly change lifelong learning and positively impact further education colleges, positioning them as central to their local areas. Personal development is fundamental to the goal of regional improvement and is also a key principle of Conservatism.",Human Impact
"This is excellent news for Max Buxton and for representatives in other areas facing similar challenges, and it exemplifies our approach to work. When you—if I may use that phrase, Madam Speaker—and members across the House secure a successful outcome for one constituent, it often benefits many others, especially when we assist Governments of all political backgrounds in recognizing the need for change and amending regulations.

By collaborating closely with individuals from another constituency—in this case, Hull—I was able to support children in my own area in accessing the free dental check available to all children. This was an initiative we had attempted locally but found difficult to implement effectively on our own. We therefore drew on the example of a practice called Teeth Team. Chris Groombridge and his colleagues provided assistance and continue to do so. The key takeaway from this example and brief contribution is that continued cross-party cooperation in this Chamber, on both significant and minor matters, enables us to improve society and enhance the lives of those we represent.",Human Impact
"Our current objective, as it was last year, is to ensure that everyone is aware of the risks associated with maintaining universal credit in its present form. While Brexit remains a prominent topic in the news, we must continue to focus on the Prime Minister’s goal of establishing a Government that serves those who are “just managing,” with the necessary focus and resources to achieve this. It is important to show that we are not only an effective Conservative Government but also one that displays compassion. Attention to detail is crucial. This involves moving beyond broad statistics to consider the individual impact—the financial costs and the specific cases recorded. It requires a thorough understanding of the consequences of policy changes.

Many families on low incomes continue to face significant challenges. Factors such as high housing costs, slow wage growth, ongoing inflation (with the exception of today), and the overall cost of living indicate that the reform of our benefits and work systems remains an ongoing process. Brexit suggests that normal operations may not resume for some time; indeed, the anticipated economic instability ahead could make circumstances considerably more difficult—by an estimated £1,000 per year in earnings—before even factoring in reductions to universal credit.",Human Impact
"I will start my comments this evening by acknowledging the many individuals who have relocated to Scotland to establish their lives here. Each person contributes significantly to Scotland’s narrative, and their involvement enriches the fabric of Scottish society, making Scotland a better place to live, work, and prosper. I speak from experience, as although I was not born in Scotland, I was welcomed here, and it will always be the place I consider home.

Although my early years were spent in Northern Ireland within the Unionist tradition, my subsequent time in Scotland revealed to me that there is no single British identity: there is no single nation. We are distinct countries with different values, principles, and political outlooks.",Human Impact
"The hon. Gentleman has articulately outlined the experiences his sons have enjoyed while travelling across the EU. Does this not fundamentally concern education and the chances available to our youth to travel? Was the support for Brexit not notably higher in areas where educational opportunities were limited?

Challenges include difficulties in obtaining necessary documents and advice, potential loss of contact with family members who provide eligibility for status, restrictions on submitting applications by post during the covid pandemic, and Government warnings about anticipated processing delays due to the crisis. While Ministers have suggested that late applications will be accepted under these conditions, it is important to secure a firm assurance that every child will receive the legal status they are entitled to.",Human Impact
"It is inequitable that a significant number of individuals have been left without any Government assistance related to covid. This group includes people like one of my constituents, a television director, who only became self-employed in April 2019 and therefore did not meet the cutoff date for SEISS payments and was ineligible for furlough. Consequently, they were forced to leave their home and depend on universal credit. They asked me, “Why am I being treated unfairly as a taxpayer? It is not my choice to be self-employed in my profession.” This question deserves attention.

During the pandemic, another challenge arose with the end of visa-free travel, which severely affected many performers. One constituent remarked, “Brexit has effectively made an already demanding career even more challenging.” The Minister for Digital and Culture responded to my concerns by describing the situation as “regrettable.” I hope that the Minister’s response will extend beyond expressions of regret.

This discussion has highlighted the vital contribution of the arts and creative industries to our country’s culture and economy. Therefore, those working in these sectors should be central to our recovery from the coronavirus crisis. The Government must increase its support for them as we move forward from the pandemic’s effects.",Human Impact
"These discussions should begin with the understanding that immigration from the EU has positively impacted this country, and that the contributions of EU nationals will continue to provide advantages regardless of their stance on Brexit. Evidence of this is readily available. For instance, in the past week alone within the realm of sports, we have witnessed the remarkable abilities of Emma Raducanu, an 18-year-old rising British tennis player who reached the last 16 at Wimbledon. With a Romanian father and a Chinese mother, she was brought up in the United Kingdom and has impressed everyone with her athletic skill, achievements, and future promise. Similarly, the football teams across the home nations have benefited from immigration. A noteworthy image shared on social media by the Migration Museum highlighted that eight of the starting eleven players in the England team that recently defeated Germany were either children or grandchildren of immigrants to this country; this was a particularly striking illustration.",Human Impact
"The priority is to implement a comprehensive transformation of the city’s transport system to reduce congestion caused by private vehicles and improve the efficiency of bus and rail services. The impact of Beeching’s cuts on Stoke-on-Trent was extensive, with numerous branch lines and stations closed, a situation that deteriorated further over time. For example, the Strategic Rail Authority closed Etruria station in 2005 and completely removed it in 2008. There is a clear need for enhanced public transport in Stoke-on-Trent. Securing a substantial portion of funds such as the transforming cities fund, the bus fund, and the reverse Beeching fund is essential to address the long-standing lack of investment that has resulted in the city missing out on its equitable share. Additionally, Stoke-on-Trent’s unique structure, comprising six towns within one city, positions it well to serve as a pilot location for the superbus project, potentially providing a model for other areas.",Human Impact
"I need to highlight a concerning point regarding the absence of a successor to one of Scotland’s most significant EU-funded initiatives, the LEADER programme. This scheme currently backs over 900 projects throughout rural Scotland, including 400 aimed at young people and disadvantaged communities. The shared prosperity fund does not serve as a replacement, nor do we identify clear avenues to obtain comparable support. When asked in the Scottish Parliament about the reasoning behind the priority groups for the levelling-up fund, the Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities stated:

“The conclusion about whether funding has been distributed equitably will come at the end of the process.”",Human Impact
"Clare Short, the former International Development Secretary who established DFID, and I provided testimony to the Select Committee regarding the challenges that agencies sometimes encounter. These agencies can inadvertently breach counter-terrorism regulations, which negatively impact their critical humanitarian efforts. Operating in areas without effective governance poses difficulties, as it often requires engagement with individuals of questionable character. The legislation introduced under the Foreign Secretary’s leadership aims to offer clearer guidelines for donors working through NGOs and for banks concerned about compliance with these rules. It is intended to mitigate the issue of banks withdrawing services—such as restricting NGOs’ access to bank accounts or hindering fund transfers—due to fears of sanction violations. The Bill is expected to alleviate banks’ apprehensions, support transport and logistics firms, facilitate NGOs’ use of formal banking systems, and reduce or eliminate informal money transfers, which, as Members on both sides of the House recognize, represent a significantly larger flow of funds to developing countries than official aid.",Human Impact

This advancement offers significant advantages, though there are concerns regarding its impact on employment. Accordingly, in the UK, we are fostering a supportive environment for technology firms to succeed through our updated industrial strategy, while also investing in education and skill development to enable individuals to benefit from the emerging jobs and opportunities.

"I would like to return to the Queen’s Speech and discuss matters concerning my constituency. I welcome the explicit mention of ensuring more equitable funding for schools. For a considerable period, Torbay’s schools have received some of the lowest per-pupil funding in the country, a situation that urgently requires correction. Torbay faces various inequalities and is not merely an area for retirees; there are significant challenges present. Our schools merit appropriate and fair funding. Therefore, I am glad to see a renewed commitment to this issue. While it will be necessary to carefully review the funding formula to ensure it operates effectively for all areas, existing concerns should not justify maintaining the current formula, which puts many children in my constituency at a disadvantage.",Human Impact
"I appreciate the hon. Gentleman’s contribution and would gently suggest that there appears to be considerable room for reasonable reciprocal agreements between completely open immigration and fully closed immigration policies. Such arrangements could enable us to maintain control over immigration levels, including residency and welfare criteria, while ensuring that incoming individuals are financially independent and that appropriate security screenings and deportation measures are in place. It seems to me that we may share similar views on this point. There is significant potential for prudent diplomatic solutions that lie between the extremes of no immigration and unrestricted immigration.

Turning now to the specific amendments and new clauses, the Government’s commitments should suffice to address concerns that might lead to support for new clauses 1, 18, or 99. The Government have appropriately pledged to allow Parliament a vote on the final agreement, and I commend the shadow Minister, the hon. and learned Member for Holborn and St Pancras (Keir Starmer), for his measured, thoughtful, and responsible approach to this issue.",Human Impact
"Regarding social care and our hospitals, I acknowledge the additional funds allocated in the Budget, though many Members, including myself, face some local challenges. Currently, hospital beds are available in both Honiton and Seaton; however, there is a plan to remove these beds from both locations. This would result in an area of about 100 square miles lacking any hospital beds. Those managing the health service must consider the large size of Devon and the distances residents must travel to reach hospitals, including visitors attending patients. Cottage hospitals play a valuable role in alleviating some of the demand on acute hospitals, so it is important to secure funding for them. While it is necessary to provide more care in people’s homes, hospital care remains essential.",Human Impact
"The Bill represents a significant disappointment for the many migrants, including those from the EU, who have contributed extensively to the NHS and care sector during the covid pandemic. The Ministers’ proposal that a salary threshold of £25,600 serves as a marker of skill is misguided. It is clear that the expertise, dedication, and commitment demonstrated by migrants during the covid crisis cannot be quantified by income, yet Ministers appear to rely on an arbitrary financial benchmark to assess an individual’s societal contribution.

EU migrants are essential not only in the NHS and care sectors but also in construction. Their prominent presence in construction is not due to a lack of skill; rather, as developers often highlight, they possess valuable construction skills that are difficult to source domestically. Additionally, they contribute significantly to the hospitality industry. EU migrants should have been granted settled status automatically, provided with physical documentation rather than just a digital code, and policy should not be moving toward increasing restrictions on EU migrants.",Human Impact
"I welcome the Secretary of State’s commitment to setting out his vision for a green Brexit within the Bill. The prominence given to environmental issues in the Bill’s drafting is commendable, and the Secretary of State along with his team at DEFRA have rightly received recognition from environmental groups for their advocacy on these matters. However, we must be cautious not to impose a London-centric, non-governmental organisation’s interpretation of environmentalism on the wider country. While I believe that is not the Secretary of State’s intention, there is a risk that farmers and farming could be portrayed as harmful to the environment, despite much of the positive work in our rural areas being carried out by farmers.",Human Impact
"I express my gratitude to the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) for his significant input to the report.

It is evident that without Sinn Féin’s cooperation, the proposals regarding the committee structure at Stormont, among other things, cannot be effectively implemented. This is a fundamental aspect of the power-sharing arrangement, which is a key component of the Good Friday agreement. I encourage Sinn Féin, the Democratic Unionist party, and all other parties in Northern Ireland to move beyond the disagreements that hinder progress and focus on the areas where consensus can be reached.

There appears to be growing frustration among the people of Northern Ireland due to ongoing political disputes and unproductive conflict. Essential issues affecting their daily lives, including healthcare, education, and infrastructure, are not being addressed because politicians are prioritising their positions over practical governance. While these political matters are important to elected representatives, the wider community generally believes they should not prevent the effective administration of Northern Ireland.",Human Impact
"The vote revealed a nation that is split, and my measure is whether the Prime Minister has proven that her agreement can unify the country. This agreement fails to do so. The electorate’s decision was not based solely on technical details or institutions, but on the broader context of their everyday experiences.

Politics involves more than mere transactions; it encompasses all aspects of society. Labour proposes a programme aimed at tackling inequality, division, and poverty, while ending austerity. It intends to restore our fractured nation and rebuild relationships within the EU and internationally, providing genuine hope and stability.

Regarding the Windrush matter, the Government should recognise the significant disappointment and fear experienced by the Windrush individuals. It appears that, perhaps due to their advanced age, the Government may be inclined to delay resolution—[Interruption.] That seems to be the perception; I encourage members to engage directly with those affected—[Interruption.] The Home Secretary’s response has not been sufficiently prompt, and it is my view that only a Labour Government can deliver justice to the Windrush generation.

I noted the Home Secretary’s comments about border protection. However, if the UK leaves the EU, we will forfeit the European arrest warrant and access to crucial criminal and missing persons databases, as well as the cooperation benefits currently enjoyed as EU members. Therefore, it may be premature to emphasise border protection when some key tools to assist the Government in maintaining public safety will be lost.",Human Impact
"I will address Brexit in more detail later; however, I wish to first raise an issue requiring immediate attention, which we have already discussed with the Immigration Minister—specifically, the status of non-European Economic Area crew members working on the Scottish fishing fleet. This is not about unskilled labour, as is sometimes assumed; rather, it concerns fishermen who are skilled and qualified professionals. Similar to agriculture, a sector I am familiar with, fishing is a profession that demands passion to succeed. Like farming, it often runs in families. Many fishermen have a heritage in the trade, whether they were born in coastal towns such as Peterhead, Fraserburgh, or Macduff in my constituency, or in countries like the Philippines or beyond.

The industry acknowledges the necessity of a gradual transition towards sustainability in terms of local labour supply, but this will require time, largely due to the need to reverse the effects of long-standing top-down EU policies, such as the Common Fisheries Policy. It would be beneficial and appreciated if the Government would begin by formally acknowledging the Scottish fleet’s requirement for non-EEA crew members.",Human Impact
"The Government will no doubt argue that the effects on the creative industries and individuals’ ability to obtain visas for work-related travel will be managed through a system of immigration based on reciprocal agreements with the EU. However, for those in the creative sector, this situation is not a matter of one side gaining at the expense of the other. There are mutual benefits to be gained if EU nationals can work in the UK, as evidenced by the presence of renowned orchestras and artists exhibiting in our galleries.

It is therefore essential to clarify the Government’s plans at this stage and to ensure that new clause 37 is adopted to allow for the monitoring of the consequences of these policies. I ask the Minister: what vision does the Government have for the future of our creative industries? What forms of reciprocity are being considered concerning social security arrangements and other practical factors that affect the ability of creative professionals to work in different parts of Europe? How does the Government intend to support the capacity of our leading artists, musicians, and creative talents to work across Europe, as well as the ability of their European counterparts to work in the UK? The outcome of this could significantly influence the future of one of the UK’s key sectors.",Human Impact
"I find it quite challenging to respond to that question. I acknowledge that, due to the priorities of this House, Northern Ireland often does not receive the level of attention it deserves. Throughout my career, I have been fortunate to hear the perspectives of many individuals from Northern Ireland. For instance, I have attended the annual conference of the Centre for Cross Border Studies, and anyone examining cross-border matters would understand the severe consequences a no-deal Brexit could bring. I would simply tell my hon. Friends that I recognise there are undoubtedly areas in which they have expertise that I do not possess.

When my hon.

"There have been no new developments in the negotiations, and the Ministers have not provided any additional information. Instead, the Government appears willing to allow the wider population to face rising food costs, at a time when many already rely on food banks, experience shortages of medical supplies that will impact the most vulnerable, and suffer from cuts to public services that have been affected by a decade of austerity, limiting educational and employment prospects for young people compared to previous generations.

All Members of Parliament should strive to support and safeguard these individuals. This is a fundamental principle of our democratic system. The current approach to politics, characterized by significant reductions, is likely to have long-term negative effects across these islands and Europe, with the greatest impact on people in the United Kingdom. This situation can be reversed through legislative action. We have a responsibility to act on behalf of the most vulnerable and those who will be most adversely affected.",Human Impact

For those who hold this perspective and acknowledge our essential role within the United Kingdom—I am aware that many have experienced the difficulties of accepting compromises within the withdrawal agreement to secure Brexit for England, while recognizing that the outcome will differ for Northern Ireland—I sincerely hope they will view new clause 7 favorably. This clause does not conflict with the Government’s stance—they have not raised any fundamental objections to it—nor does it disrupt the Brexit process that Members aim to pursue. Nevertheless, it would provide significant practical support to businesses in Northern Ireland facing uncertainty and a lack of confidence regarding forthcoming arrangements, and, in the event of any adverse effects, it would assure them that the Government will offer support.",Human Impact

I would like to point out that individuals aged 16 and 17, who will be most impacted by this decision as future European citizens, were excluded from voting.

"Lastly, new clause 18 addresses migration levels. The political declaration confirms the plan to end free movement. This presents a considerable challenge, which the SNP has consistently opposed whenever possible. While we do not support leaving the EU, if the UK is resolved to do so and implement its own immigration policy, it requires one without a £30,000 salary threshold and one that permits individuals to live and work in Scotland. Should the UK Government be unwilling to adopt such measures, they ought to transfer the relevant powers to Scotland to enable this, or alternatively, Scotland should be given the opportunity to pursue independence once more, thereby allowing for a more suitable immigration policy.

The demographic profile of Scotland shows a more rapid ageing population compared to the rest of the UK. Within the UK, EU nationals make up 15% of the workforce in the agriculture and food sector. In contrast, a local business in my constituency employs over 50% EU nationals. Across Scotland, 7% of residents are international migrants, with the proportion of those born outside the UK being notably higher in Aberdeen.",Human Impact
"Despite the Secretary of State’s vigorous statements, it must be acknowledged that the Prime Minister’s agreement poses significant challenges for workers’ rights. Scottish workers and industries now confront the possibility of Conservative trade agreements that could reduce environmental and other essential standards. The Conservatives’ track record on workers’ rights remains questionable, and any contrary belief is unfounded. The Prime Minister secured Labour support for his contentious deal by promising “the highest possible standards.” However, within days, that assurance, like many others, was undermined.

EU legislation and judicial oversight currently serve as safeguards against the erosion of UK workers’ rights. It is understood that this Government intends to diverge from key regulations following Brexit. Is it not true that the sole means to ensure the protection of workers’ rights and prevent their dilution is continued membership of the EU? As highlighted by the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations:

“Loss of oversight from, and recourse to, the European Court of Justice will remove…protection from UK citizens.”

At the very least, will the Secretary of State commit to conducting an equality impact assessment regarding the UK Government’s post-Brexit plans for workers’ rights? If not, could the Secretary of State explain the reasons?",Human Impact
"In contrast to some individuals who have expressed strong emotions regarding this decision, the Secretary of State and I actively sought endorsement for leaving both the common fisheries policy and the European Union as a whole. I recall the commitments made during our visit to Aberdeen, and it is understandable that many people feel worried about the draft agreement. The Secretary of State has stated that the EU will act in good faith throughout the transition period and will not attempt to weaken existing fishing communities.

Members. I hold a session at 10 am daily and have done so for several weeks. This is not intended as a political statement, but rather an open invitation to all hon. Members: if businesses are encountering challenges for any reason, please do reach out. Although we would have preferred to have resolved this matter sooner, we are not willing to make concessions on issues that are critically important to many of her constituents. While we will not compromise on these points, we are working diligently to address the remaining concerns, and I am hopeful that we will soon be able to offer her constituents and others the clarity they require.",Human Impact
"The response is significantly insufficient relative to the magnitude of the issue.

The Prime Minister initially declared the construction of 40 new hospitals, a figure that was reduced to six shortly thereafter. Meanwhile, the increasing and ageing population continues to place greater demands on healthcare services, exceeding both capacity and service standards. This situation results in limitations on access and a decline in the standard of care. Numerous Members from both sides of the House have mentioned these concerns during today’s discussion.",Human Impact
"My hon. Friend is entirely correct. The appropriate method to respond to the concerns of his constituents, my constituents, and those of all of us, and indeed the way to deflate the considerable toxic bubble surrounding Brexit, is simply to proceed and ensure that the term “Brexit”—recognizing there is considerable sensitivity around the terminology—is not mentioned at all in 2020. Would that not be an excellent outcome?",Human Impact
"I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mike Hill) and concur with several of the points he raised in his remarks. As the House continues its discussion on the Queen’s Speech, it becomes increasingly clear that one of the significant consequences of a Conservative Brexit will be the impact on the United Kingdom’s National Health Service.

The NHS represents one of our most valuable national institutions; it emerged from a blend of progressive and visionary ideas in the previous century, establishing healthcare accessible to all based on need rather than financial capacity. However, in the current century, the NHS faces serious risks due to a problematic mix of persistent underfunding and the effects of leaving the European Union, alongside confronting challenges that differ considerably from those at its inception many years ago.

Despite the commitments outlined in the Queen’s Speech, it is important to state plainly that the NHS is not currently receiving the necessary funding to operate effectively. This issue was discussed just yesterday in the Health and Social Care Committee, where the Secretary of State was present, and we addressed the existing backlog of £6 billion required for NHS repairs alone. Therefore, an announcement providing only half of that amount cannot be regarded as a significant achievement. Additionally, the Health Foundation provided its evaluation of the funding proposals in the Queen’s Speech, noting that...",Human Impact
"The issue at hand is that reciprocal healthcare does not exist independently; its purpose is to support the freedom of movement. Individuals cannot fully exercise their rights to move freely if they are unable to afford healthcare in the locations where they choose to live, work, form relationships, settle, or retire. For several decades, people have had the ability to retire and settle in various places. Many are familiar with my husband’s situation as a German national residing here who has spent nearly his entire adult life employed within our healthcare system. This was undoubtedly his primary concern following the Brexit referendum, and I believe it is a concern shared by the five million individuals who have either settled here from Europe or have established themselves in Europe from the UK.",Human Impact
"My right hon. Friend is correct in noting that I reiterated the hope that the matter of EU nationals residing in the UK and UK nationals living in EU countries can be addressed promptly at the start of the negotiations. The other member states and the Council have stated that they will not commence discussions until article 50 is activated. Nonetheless, I will persist in emphasizing our desire to resolve this issue early on, as it is important to provide clarity and reassurance to those affected, allowing them to proceed with their lives.",Human Impact
"Certainly. It is well known that among the minority in Scotland who voted to leave the EU, a considerable number were individuals employed in the fishing sector, including fishermen. This is due to the fact that, as mentioned earlier, they have experienced unfavorable outcomes over time resulting from unsuccessful negotiations by the UK Government regarding the common fisheries policy—negotiations from which Scottish Government Ministers have been excluded. The key benefit of this compromise plan for fishermen is that, although it involves leaving the common fisheries policy, they would retain access to the single market. During my visit to Norway, I observed a presentation outlining the progress of the Norwegian fishing industry under a similar arrangement, which, I can assure you, is performing notably better than the Scottish fishing industry.",Human Impact
"I will keep my remarks concise, as we are approaching an important phase in the proceedings.

Similar to many hon. Members, especially those on the Opposition benches, I voted to remain in the European Union. Like others, I was actively involved in my constituency and across the West Midlands advocating for that position, particularly addressing the manufacturers and traders for which the area is known. I, along with many others, was disappointed by the outcome of the referendum. While the overall result was close at 48% to 52%, in Coventry the vote was 40% to remain and 60% to leave.

When the matter of triggering article 50 came before the House, I was clear in my view—I would not oppose a decision made through a democratic vote—and thus supported the action taken. Nonetheless, I expressed two conditions I considered crucial to mitigate the most severe consequences of Brexit: the establishment of a transitional period for the new arrangements, and that these arrangements be as flexible as possible. I maintain that these conditions remain relevant today. I chose to observe how effectively the Government would pursue these objectives. Regrettably, there has been little noticeable progress either domestically or within Europe.",Human Impact
"I am unable to yield the floor any further as numerous Members wish to contribute.

It is clear that the Brexit vote reflects significant dissatisfaction among working-class voters, with concerns about migration and free movement. My right hon. and learned Friend representing Holborn and St Pancras outlined a number of issues that can be tackled, and the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown highlighted additional matters in his speech last week. There are steps that can be taken to respond to working-class concerns, but initiating this process should not involve choosing a course that would reduce the nation’s wealth and thereby limit the resources necessary for public services, regeneration, housing, and improving opportunities for working-class communities.",Human Impact

"The Government has prudently considered the Norway model regarding fisheries management, as Norway maintains substantially greater authority over its maritime areas and promptly closes them if overfishing occurs. Consequently, the Fisheries Bill presents a valuable chance to implement a more responsive fisheries management framework. Additionally, the Bill offers an important opportunity to improve the prospects of coastal communities and small-scale fishers, and I appreciate the approach taken by our DEFRA Ministers. I also anticipate supporting sea anglers across the country to ensure their continued access to fish, recognizing their significant contribution both economically to the fishing sector and to recreational fishing.

I express my support for the Bill this evening.",Human Impact
"A constituent of mine submitted an application to the EU settlement scheme in September 2019 for herself and her son. After a wait of fifteen months, she has yet to receive a decision on her case.

"Regrettably, although most of my comments have focused on cancer, I must also, as always, address the issue of Brexit. As we exit the European Union, it is crucial to emphasise the importance of maintaining collaboration with our European counterparts in funding and conducting research into rare cancers. It is essential that we remain involved in EU research and development initiatives that hold significant international value. Additionally, ongoing cooperation with the European Association for Cancer Research is necessary, as we cannot afford to lose access to potential new cancer treatments in the pursuit of what I consider a misguided notion of reclaiming sovereignty. In fact, the current treatment protocols are established at the EU level.",Human Impact
"Over the weekend, the Home Secretary was sent a letter from representatives of the police, faith communities, and civil society groups, highlighting significant worries regarding the proposed Bill. It would be inappropriate for her to disregard these concerns and proceed without consideration. The Prevent duty, which requires reporting extremist conduct, is contributing to a perception that the Muslim community is being disproportionately scrutinised. This is fostering an environment of suspicion and mistrust. From my perspective, should the Government choose to introduce further legislation that expands what is seen as a restrictive and potentially discriminatory measure, it may not address extremism effectively and could instead create circumstances that allow it to grow.",Human Impact
"Lords amendment 3 proposes to expedite the settled status process for children in care and those leaving care. It is likely that all Members would concur that the Government should take all necessary measures to ensure that everyone eligible to apply for settled status through the EU settlement scheme is informed about the scheme. There is a significant and justified concern that children in care from the EEA and Switzerland might be overlooked. The Home Office estimates that approximately 5,000 looked-after children and 4,000 care leavers in the UK will need to apply under the EU settlement scheme. However, research conducted by the Children’s Society indicates that 153 out of 211 local authorities across the UK have identified only 3,612 EEA and Swiss children in care and care leavers, with just 11% having obtained status to date.",Human Impact
"The chairman of Maritime UK has indicated that without an agreement on Brexit, freight drivers may face delays of up to two days on the primary routes leading to Dover.

What specific guarantees can the Secretary of State provide to ensure that such disruptions will be avoided?",Human Impact
"That is acceptable, but within my west London constituency, many individuals can only aspire to have a home, much less to own one. Both young people and those not so young are unlikely to move out of their parents’ residences. Families often reside in substandard temporary housing that is barely affordable, and they face ongoing uncertainty about relocation, which can last for extended periods. Their prospects appear bleak. The Red Book accurately notes that average house prices in London are twelve times the average earnings of a worker, and it further states:

“The only sustainable way to make housing more affordable over the long term is to build more homes in the right places.”

However, there is no conclusive evidence to demonstrate that increasing housing supply in London would reduce prices in the current distorted market. Moreover, even if prices were reduced by a few thousand pounds on new homes, this would not assist my constituents who earn under £100,000 or lack a substantial deposit typically provided by family support.",Human Impact
"I am worried that an increasing number of children will be affected by the “no recourse to public funds” restriction due to changes in the immigration system, including some children born in the United Kingdom. While I acknowledge the assistance available under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, it does not fully address the issue. On 7 May, an eight-year-old British boy, supported by his migrant mother, secured a High Court decision that the policy preventing families like his from accessing welfare support violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the precarious situation of families subject to the “no recourse to public funds” condition, and it is urgent that we receive information on how the Government plans to respond to this ruling.",Human Impact
"When agreeing to this extension, the Council engaged in some debate over whether the UK should face strict conditions for its EU membership during this timeframe, but I opposed that approach. I maintained that EU membership exists on a single level, without additional conditions beyond those already set out in existing treaties.

In response, I gave assurances to other leaders that the UK will remain fully committed to all its responsibilities as a member state, including the obligation of sincere cooperation.

"In this discussion, it is important for Parliament to begin reaffirming certain principles that perhaps should have been emphasized more strongly during the referendum campaign. To begin, let us consider immigration. Immigration has been beneficial to the United Kingdom and has brought advantages to the country. This point should be communicated clearly and repeatedly, as it is a position that essentially all Members of this House would endorse. So why is this message not being expressed more forcefully? Why do we not confront those promoting intolerance and prejudice with greater determination? I refer here to migration in general, not solely immigration. While there have been challenges associated with migration, overall it has had a positive impact on the country. This is not to dismiss the issues that exist, which must certainly be addressed. However, if we concede ground on these matters, populist and anti-establishment sentiments tend to fill the resulting void. This represents a shortcoming of the referendum campaign.",Moral Value
"Seldom have I encountered a question founded on such a number of incorrect assumptions. In reality, exiting the European Union does entail departing from the single market, as membership in the single market depends on the four freedoms. Regardless of opinions on last year’s referendum, it was evidently not a decision to maintain the regulation of migration, legal authority, and the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice within Europe.",Moral Value
"The only way to honour the electorate at the time of the election is to provide the public with a vote on Brexit, returning control to the people through a confirmatory referendum that offers a genuine choice between a viable leave option and remaining. However, I do not believe that resolving Brexit or ""completing it"" will reunite the country. Until we recognise that the outcome of the 2016 EU referendum concerned more than just the EU, we will be unable to reconcile the nation. Deep down, we must acknowledge that the vote was not exclusively about trade agreements, single markets, or judicial systems.",Moral Value

"I am pleased to speak after the right hon. Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon). I share some of his apprehensions regarding the possible dilution of targets that are set by Ministers and then implemented or assessed by an entity appointed by those same Ministers.

It is crucial to recall the reason for our discussion today. This debate is a consequence of Brexit. Historically, in the 1970s, the UK was regarded as the most polluting country in Europe—or perhaps more accurately, the most polluting nation—and discharged untreated sewage into the sea. However, due to the European Union’s regulations ensuring a level playing field, which prevent member states from undermining environmental standards to gain competitive advantage, we now benefit from cleaner coastlines, increased use of fuel-efficient vehicles, and a decrease in the amount of waste sent to landfill.",Moral Value
"I encourage the Secretary of State to utilise the existing environmental legislation inherited from the EU, incorporating and modifying it to suit our needs more effectively. It is important that we uphold our commitments on climate change—I welcome the Prime Minister’s previous remarks on this matter—and, as noted by my hon. Friend the Member for Louth and Horncastle (Victoria Atkins), preserve our stringent standards regarding food security, animal welfare, and nuclear safety. Additionally, we need to address the management of seasonal workers to ensure the continued progress of our industries.

Through mutual understanding, collaboration, and attentiveness to the concerns of people not only in Taunton Deane but across the country, I remain hopeful that we can create a stronger future for upcoming generations. With this in mind, I will be supporting the Government’s motion to invoke article 50.",Moral Value

I have never contemplated such a course of action, nor would I.",Moral Value
"I regret that I will not be able to yield the floor, as my time is very limited.

Earlier in the debate, my right hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry) raised a point regarding fairness and the use of language, highlighting the necessity of distinguishing between asylum and immigration pathways. She was entirely correct in this observation. I often find it quite frustrating when the terms “asylum seeker,” “refugee,” and “economic migrant” are used interchangeably. I have previously emphasized the need for careful use of terminology, and the Home Secretary responded to my right hon. Friend’s intervention by noting the significance of appropriate language and tone.

I acknowledge that there are strong and deeply held opinions on immigration across the House. I appreciate my hon. Friend the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Steve Double) for correctly stressing the need for a mature and constructive discussion. He also appropriately highlighted challenges faced by particular sectors of the economy. In response to this, we are conducting a year of engagement on the White Paper, consulting with representatives from various industries. My hon.

Does he believe that unelected members of the House of Lords should have the authority to decide on this matter, or should that responsibility rest solely with the House of Commons?",Moral Value
"I appreciate the Minister’s statement and the opportunity to review it in advance.

It is entirely appropriate for the current Government to present their stance and the relevant details concerning our EU membership, similar to the approach taken by the Labour Government during the 1975 referendum when they distributed their well-known red, white, and blue leaflet. In fact, the Government has a duty to communicate their perspective, particularly given that this represents the most significant political decision faced by the British public in over four decades. The public rightly anticipate a well-informed discussion supported by factual information. Over recent months, I have spoken to many constituents who have expressed a desire for clear facts. This leaflet will, at the very least, provide those facts to the public.

The leaflet’s purpose is made explicit on the cover, which states:

“Why the Government believes that voting to remain in the European Union is the best decision for the UK.”",Moral Value
"As I mentioned in my statement, we remain dedicated to the Belfast agreement and all agreements that follow it. The stance outlined in the Conservative party manifesto during the previous election, as well as that of this Government, is that the Belfast agreement represents the appropriate framework.

The joint report signed prior to Christmas explicitly includes a commitment to the Belfast agreement and to upholding the institutions established by it.",Moral Value
"It is not particularly unexpected to observe divisions among Labour Members. I appreciate the contribution from the hon. Gentleman. While he raises a valid point, our perspectives differ. Our experience during the Scottish independence referendum, which I will address further, contrasts with his view.

Increasing political engagement among young people is essential. This is a matter on which everyone in the Committee can find common ground. Even when there are disagreements on other aspects, I am confident that the hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) will concur on this point. I acknowledge that his opinions are sincerely held. During the independence referendum, an impressive 75% of 16 and 17-year-olds participated in voting. According to the same survey, 97% of those who voted indicated they would participate again. The turnout in the UK general election was 66.1%, with higher figures recorded in Scotland compared to the rest of the UK—likely attributable to the Scottish independence referendum and a more politically engaged electorate. There are valuable insights here for all of us to consider.",Moral Value
"Numerous colleagues have engaged with this matter due to hearing about the experiences of a constituent’s family member or friend, or through personal acquaintance with someone affected. I, personally, do not have such a connection, but through careful consideration, listening, and reviewing the arguments, I have reached the view that this serious injustice must not persist. It raises significant moral concerns and presents substantial legal questions. Over time, the approach adopted by successive Governments—overlooking the problem and repeatedly relying on the same justification—despite recent assurances from this Government to examine the issue, will likely prove legally indefensible in an increasingly interconnected world.

It is important to remember that this situation unfolds against the backdrop of post-Brexit challenges, which will generate various consequences. There is a genuine future risk for UK nationals residing in the European Union, and I am aware that the All-Party Parliamentary Group intends to advocate vigorously for a resolution within the Brexit discussions. While debates often focus on freedom of movement and immigration, there is less attention given to emigration and the fact that many British citizens legitimately exercise their right to live, work, or retire abroad.",Moral Value

This understanding is necessary both in the preparatory period before the referendum campaign and during the campaign itself. My hon.

That is a reasonable expectation within a democratic system.",Moral Value
"This represents a form of alarmism at its most severe and objectionable. The leave campaign capitalised on legitimate concerns about poverty, unemployment, and deprivation, particularly in regions experiencing persistent unemployment over several decades that have been largely overlooked for 20 to 30 years. Immigration is not responsible for social inequality, and such alarmist tactics neither address nor resolve the underlying causes of the challenges faced by many individuals. It is successive Governments that have not effectively confronted social and economic inequality. The disparity between wealthy and poor has increased, with five families in the United Kingdom holding approximately 20% of the nation's wealth. Critical issues such as eliminating poverty and ensuring equal opportunities remain unaddressed. Immigrants are wrongly blamed for these problems and are used as a convenient focus; this was a core strategy of the Vote Leave campaign.",Moral Value

No individual party or Prime Minister has received a greater number of votes in UK history than the leave vote did in June. This was an infrequent, generational decision, and the outcome must be acknowledged.

In what manner have Russian oligarchs been permitted to move freely and attain social standing and legitimacy in the UK? Are the Government cognizant of the claims presented in the latest issue of Private Eye, which state that eight parliamentarians and officials from Moscow possess significant property holdings in London?

"At present, there are two programmes through which sanctuary can be offered to children in Europe: the Dubs scheme and Dublin III. Many Members in this Chamber expressed strong dissatisfaction that the Dubs amendment did not lead to a higher allocation of places for unaccompanied children. The Government, after consulting with local authorities, concluded that 480 was the maximum number that could be accommodated. Additionally, we have been informed this morning that the High Court has ruled in favour of the Government regarding the adequacy of that consultation process. For context, I can inform the House that the figure of 480 accounts for 0.5% of the total refugee children who have arrived in Europe to date, which equates to fewer than one per parliamentary constituency. Putting aside the legal considerations, I continue to find our contribution insufficient. It does not compare favourably with the significant number of 23,000 refugees from the Syrian region whom we plan to resettle by 2020 under the vulnerable persons resettlement scheme.

There has been considerable attention surrounding this Bill. We have engaged in nearly 70 hours of discussion, which is certainly valuable, yet there has also been significant emphasis placed on it. Essentially, this Bill incorporates into domestic legislation provisions that were formerly part of EU law. It does not alter the manner in which we exit the EU. Consequently, I note with approval the emerging willingness to reach a compromise today. I am pleased that there appears to be support for voting, if a vote occurs, in favor of amendment 400 and the original amendment 381, which specifies the date within the Bill. Perhaps the date should have been included initially, as Brexit signifies the UK’s departure from the EU, scheduled for 29 March 2019.

It concerns how we collaborate with others who uphold these principles to create and sustain a rules-based international framework that safeguards them.

Regrettably, the events witnessed last week in the United States demonstrate how vulnerable the principle of democracy can be when challenged by populism and nationalism, amplified through social media platforms. At this juncture for the United Kingdom—following Brexit, managing covid, and facing ongoing social and economic consequences—it is crucial that we reject tendencies toward nationalism and isolationism and acknowledge the significance of global Britain. Indeed, this importance is greater now than ever before.",Moral Value
"As we remain a member of the European Union, it is appropriate that we advance the Bill without delay. Our discussions are not about departing the EU under unfavorable circumstances, so it is fitting that we take the necessary time to examine these matters as responsible EU members. Among the four procedures addressed in the Bill, two involve granting Serbia and Albania observer status within the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights. This agency succeeded the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia. Its role includes gathering data on fundamental rights and engaging with the public and civil society to address related challenges. This appears to closely align with the functions carried out by the Council of Europe. I have just returned from Strasbourg, where the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe continues its plenary session. While this institution requires significant reform and improvement, there was earlier discussion regarding potential post-Brexit engagement with such bodies. It occurs to me that, should we choose, we might explore ways to strengthen an organisation like the Council of Europe and consolidate efforts, rather than creating overlapping initiatives.",Moral Value
"In the aftermath of the 2016 referendum, and considering the policies of the two principal parties in 2017, it is our shared duty to act. The sensible, accountable, and pragmatic course is to pass the withdrawal agreement through this House with a majority and subsequently proceed with the most effective customs arrangements. This approach would meet the approval of the majority of individuals, including, in my view, the majority in Northern Ireland.",Moral Value
"I acknowledge the upcoming inauguration of President Biden tomorrow, who will be collaborating with a newly formed Senate and House. The new Congress will have oversight of its trade agreements, but without these amendments, we will lack such oversight. Prior to negotiations, Congress is able to review and vote on broad objectives, which are then made available for public consultation. After negotiations conclude, the agreement must be approved by Congress. Why should we impose a lower standard on ourselves?

These principles have broad support across different groups and the public, including the National Farmers Union, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Greener UK, the CBI, Which?, among others—we should therefore agree to Lords amendment 1. Nonetheless, this is not the only amendment under consideration today. A petition signed by half a million people urges the Government to enshrine protections for our food standards in law. Lords amendment 6 requires that

“a Minister of the Crown ensures as far as possible that a future trade agreement is consistent with United Kingdom levels of statutory protection”

"Regarding ministerial consents, we acknowledge the streamlined process outlined in the Bill; however, the Government has the opportunity to go further. The Welsh Affairs Committee has suggested implementing a 60-day deadline within which consent must be either granted or denied. Incorporating such a provision would enhance certainty, and I encourage the Government to contemplate enshrining this requirement in legislation.

Turning to income tax, at present, the people of Wales must approve the devolution of income tax powers through a referendum before these powers can be transferred to the Assembly. This Bill removes that prerequisite, allowing the Secretary of State to devolve income tax authority via an Order in Council, without the Assembly’s consent. This approach raises concerns. The ability of the Assembly to impose taxes represents a major constitutional change, and it should not occur absent a definitive democratic endorsement. Therefore, we request that the Secretary of State consider amending the Bill to mandate the Assembly’s approval prior to the devolution of tax powers.",Moral Value
"My hon. Friend has highlighted several aspects concerning the Bill introduced by the right hon. Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford. In light of the Government’s existing commitments on these matters, I would encourage Members to recognize that the provisions within the Bill carry constitutional consequences that extend beyond the Brexit issue, particularly regarding the interaction between Government and Parliament and the future of our democratic institutions. I have been explicit today in stating that I seek a deal that this House can endorse and that allows us to leave on 29 March with an agreed arrangement. This is the objective the Government is pursuing and remains committed to.",Moral Value
"The key point highlighted in the article by Professor Bogdanor, which the Brexit Secretary has extensively cited, is that while the amendment is a necessary measure, it alone is not adequate, because Parliament cannot overturn the decision made by the public in a referendum. This position is clearly stated in the article, as well as by the Liberal Democrats, though our perspective differs from some Brexit supporters on the Government side. We hold the view that after Parliament has reviewed the final agreement or the lack thereof, the public should have the ultimate decision on the matter. This is not an unusual stance. Nations that operate by means of referendums, such as Switzerland, routinely use confirmatory referendums. In such systems, the population votes first, followed by legislative and executive consideration, and finally a confirmatory referendum to decide whether the people approve the proposal. There is no reason why this approach should be problematic. It is a matter of fundamental—",Moral Value

The conflict in Yemen, supported by the UK and led by Saudi Arabia, continues to result in thousands of deaths, displacements, and injuries, alongside 300,000 reported cases of cholera—this situation is a crisis caused by human actions. Additionally, the Government continues to authorize arms sales to Saudi Arabia, a regime known for repression, involvement in terrorism financing, and violations of humanitarian law. Although the Court has determined that the Government’s actions are lawful, questions remain regarding the ethical considerations.

"The third principle concerns representation. I remain puzzled by those who believe Parliament should be feared. How many more votes must be held to confirm the clear support within this Chamber for carrying out the will of the British public? They have granted us a mandate, and there is no need to revisit previous debates. We possess a mandate and understand the necessity to proceed accordingly. Two votes have now taken place, indicating that Members on both sides of the House—perhaps excluding those from Scotland—acknowledge the perspective of the Union. There is no reason to be apprehensive about bringing these matters before Parliament.

After all, is it not our duty to represent the interests of our constituents? There is no desire for a second referendum, and I fully concur with my neighbour, the hon. Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), that returning to the previous position would be unreasonable. Nevertheless, we serve as a forum to raise the concerns our constituents express, many of whom still have numerous questions regarding the process ahead. We have the opportunity to pose these questions to one another and to Ministers, thereby fulfilling our representative role. The principle of representation remains essential.",Moral Value

A key factor behind our current situation—one contributing to the outcome of the Brexit referendum in June 2016 and the general election in December 2019—is precisely the issue he highlights: there was a growing loss of confidence among the public. Although significant funds existed, they did not consistently reach the intended destinations. The revised framework—the reset I mentioned earlier—will specifically tackle this matter.",Moral Value

Their work has been exceptional. While she claims there is no plan, this is incorrect. Nearly three years of preparation have been undertaken to address every possible outcome, involving thousands of civil servants who have demonstrated full dedication to implementing the decision of the referendum.

I actively supported the remain campaign, yet I acknowledge the outcome. I will not oppose the Second Reading, nor will I fault others for choosing differently. I regret that this evening the House will commence a process that I consider a mistaken path for this nation—a nation where I was born with pride, one that has influenced me through its openness and generosity, and has shaped my strong belief in international cooperation and politics. The Government’s duty at this time is more significant than ever.",Moral Value
"Certainly, this relates to the point I previously made concerning the democratic deficit. The Government are attempting, through the Bill, to remedy the shortcomings identified in the protocol. While some Members may highlight that the Government initially agreed to the protocol, I acknowledge the Government’s recognition that the protocol is ineffective, detrimental to Northern Ireland, and requires modification. This is a significant matter.

It is our position that the democratic deficit must be resolved. To date, the European Union has not demonstrated a willingness to propose measures addressing the United Kingdom’s concerns in this area. It remains uncertain whether their stance will shift, but in the meantime, we support the Government’s objective for a system that is equitable and reasonable.",Moral Value

I urge constituents to observe the effects of Government policies on their communities, businesses, families, and the prospects of future generations. When compared with similar nations, Scotland faces challenges such as lower wealth, higher inequality, reduced productivity, and increased poverty, including among children and pensioners.

Nevertheless, the point made by colleagues who voted and campaigned to leave, which I found particularly compelling and emotionally resonant, was that Parliament is sovereign and should reclaim authority over all decisions affecting the lives of my constituents. This was the aspect of the leave campaign that I found hardest to counter and the most challenging to justify compromising over for the sake of EU membership.

"I anticipate that there will be considerable discussion today regarding the effectiveness of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act. The Minister has clearly expressed the view that it did not function as intended, but there is an equally reasonable position that certain elements of the Act did operate successfully, despite its shortcomings and limitations. A notable instance is the 2015 general election, which was held five years after the 2010 election, demonstrating that the Act maintained the coalition Government’s schedule. Additionally, one could contend that the 2017 general election also illustrates the Act’s functionality, as it included provisions for calling an early election, which were utilized at that time.

The core of the debate about the Act’s performance likely revolves around the Parliament from 2017 to 2019, which arguably exposes some of the Act’s weaknesses. One significant issue was the provision allowing the Prime Minister to influence the timing of an election, which became a central concern because the Opposition suspected it might be used to proceed with a no-deal exit from the European Union.

Therefore, the Committee reasonably inquires of the Minister: what precisely is this power, and for what purpose do Ministers require it? If I understood the Minister correctly, he stated that the clause exists solely to ensure Ministers act within the law. What is meant by this “conduct”?

Upon reviewing new clause 1 multiple times, I note that it aligns with the Internal Market Act, and I acknowledge the Minister for considering the concerns we put forward, despite the Government opposing our amendments during Committee.

The Minister has responded to issues concerning areas where the devolved Administrations may offer recommendations. This represents a development from the previously mentioned “flexible” consultation approach discussed in Committee, which lacked a formal consultation process. Several hon.

Additionally, there was consensus on the necessity of addressing the ideology that supports such terrorism, which involves tackling both violent and non-violent extremism and cooperating internationally to counter online radicalisation.",None
"It is appropriate at this point to consider the following:

Amendment 51, on page 1, line 17, proposes removing the word “parliamentary” and replacing it with “local government”.

This change would permit individuals from all European Union member states residing in the UK and Gibraltar to participate in the referendum.

Amendment 1, on page 1, line 17, suggests adding at the end:

“and persons who would be so entitled except for the fact that they will be aged 16 or 17 on the date on which the referendum is to be held”.

This would grant voting rights in the referendum to British citizens, Commonwealth citizens meeting the eligibility criteria, and citizens of the Republic of Ireland who are aged 16 or 17.

Amendment 12, on page 2, line 9, recommends inserting after “Commonwealth citizens” the phrase:

“or citizens of the Republic of Ireland”.

Amendment 2, on page 2, line 12, proposes adding at the end:

“and persons who would be so entitled except for the fact that they will be aged 16 or 17 on the date on which the referendum is to be held”.

This would enable Commonwealth citizens aged 16 or 17, who are eligible to vote in Gibraltar for European Parliament elections, to cast their vote in the referendum.

"The Committee divided: Ayes 304, Noes 313.

The question was therefore negatived.

Proceedings were interrupted (Programme Order, today).

The Chair immediately put the Questions required to conclude the business at that time (Standing Order No. 83D).

An amendment was proposed: No. 22, page 2, line 3, to add at the end—

“() Nothing in this section restricts a Minister of the Crown from requesting, or consenting to, an extension of the timeframe specified in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union by means other than those set out in this section.”—(Stephen Barclay.)

This amendment clarifies that the Bill does not restrict the authority of a Minister of the Crown to seek or agree to an extension of the Article 50(3) period beyond the provisions of this section.

The question was put, That the amendment be agreed to.",None
My hon. Friend is entirely correct: this matter extends beyond the scope of article 50 and fundamentally concerns the functioning of the Crown prerogative.,None
"I acknowledge the Government’s introduction of a distinct Bill concerning the withdrawal agreement. This is an issue on which both I and the right hon. and learned Member for Beaconsfield (Mr Grieve) have submitted amendments. Could the Secretary of State provide clarification on the timeline? He mentioned that, ideally, the withdrawal agreement Bill would be presented before Brexit day. There is a significant concern if the Government intend to rely on clause 9 provisionally to enact the withdrawal agreement through secondary legislation, while postponing the withdrawal agreement Bill until after Brexit day. Will he confirm that the Government plans to present the withdrawal agreement Bill to the House prior to Brexit day, rather than subsequently?",None
"I found myself inclined to speak for a longer period than originally planned.

Having reviewed the new clauses and amendments in this section, I trust I have explained the reasons why they ought to be opposed by those supporting the initiation of article 50. Should any of these proposals be put to a vote, I trust the House will vote against them.",None
"I do not consider that to be a valid justification, as the fact remains that this is the decision—[Interruption.] Allow me to read the subsection to which the right hon. Gentleman referred. It specifies that

“subsection (2) does not apply if the House of Commons has resolved not to approve a motion proposed by a Minister of the Crown within a period of two calendar days starting from the end of the day on which the European Council’s decision is made or before the conclusion of 30 October 2019, whichever occurs first, in the following terms—

‘That this House has approved the extension to the period in Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union which the European Council has decided.’”

Nevertheless, the prospect of that not occurring is highly unlikely. I believe this serves as yet another instance of the kind of lack of clarity that this Bill introduces in nearly every section. Indeed, it goes beyond mere lack of clarity, as it fundamentally undermines the manner in which governance should be, and has been, conducted.",None
"As we approach the Easter Adjournment, I extend my best wishes to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, Mr Speaker, the Deputy Speakers, the House staff, and all Members along with their teams working within this estate, for a pleasant Easter.

I also wish everyone observing Pesach a happy celebration.",None
"I concur with my hon. Friend on both matters: reaching consensus is preferable and should be pursued whenever feasible, and article 50 is the mechanism for delivering Brexit. He is also correct in noting that this represents just a small part of a much broader issue; numerous additional elements need to be addressed alongside it. Several of these have already been referenced during this urgent question, and I anticipate further discussion on them in time.",None
"Individuals intending to initiate legal proceedings or enter into agreements during the EU withdrawal period, or shortly thereafter—considering that many commercial contracts will extend across this timeframe—will require clarity regarding the applicable law. Should the law be subject to disapplication, this would occur either through an Act of Parliament, which is appropriate, or through a judgment rendered by the High Court or, where relevant, the Supreme Court, following the established hierarchy of precedent. It would be unusual for an employment tribunal or a High Court judge at first instance to ostensibly possess the authority to disapply EU law in a manner potentially inconsistent with previous decisions from higher courts. While it is unlikely that this was intended, the current wording, without further clarification, appears to introduce the possibility of such an outcome. I trust the Minister will provide clarification on how this risk will be mitigated, as it is presumably not the Government’s objective.",None
"I would like to address amendment (a), which I have submitted and has been selected for consideration. In response to the remarks made by the hon. Member for Bath (Wera Hobhouse), she will be aware that if amendment (a) is approved, it would allow the House to hold another series of indicative votes on Monday.

Since I tabled this amendment, the Prime Minister has shown strong support for the idea of indicative votes. In her statement from Downing Street, she mentioned that, in the ongoing discussions with the Leader of the Opposition aimed at finding a way forward, if no consensus is reached,

“we would instead agree a number of options for the future relationship that we could put to the House in a series of votes to determine which course to pursue.”

This announcement is noteworthy, as the Government had previously only referred to the possibility of offering the House such a chance in general terms. Despite two rounds of indicative votes having taken place, and the Government having made three attempts to pass their withdrawal agreement or elements of it, it would seem appropriate to grant the House an additional opportunity to express its views.",None
"The fourth mechanism is Parliament, which has a significant function in examining our trade policy. The Government has supplied Parliament with extensive information regarding our negotiations, including the publication of our objectives and scoping assessments prior to the commencement of talks, and we maintain close collaboration with the relevant Select Committees. Nonetheless, the passage of the Bill has indicated that additional parliamentary oversight of trade agreements is necessary. Consequently, we have proposed an amendment obliging us to report to Parliament on the effects of new trade agreements on the preservation of our food, animal welfare, and environmental protection standards. This suggested new clause would impose a requirement on the Secretary of State to submit a report to Parliament either before or at the same time as any free trade agreement is presented to Parliament under the procedures of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. The Secretary of State for International Trade has confirmed that the Government will allocate time for debate. Should Parliament find the report unsatisfactory, it has the authority to postpone ratification through the CRaG process.",None
"For those who wish to see the United Kingdom depart from the European Union, that represents a legitimate and respectable political stance, one that Members across the House, including some Liberal Democrats, have supported. Advocating for a referendum to decide on remaining or leaving is a reasonable course of action. However, this is not the perspective I hold, nor is it the policy of the Government, and I believe it is not the position of the hon. Gentleman either.",None
"Although this statutory instrument does not specifically address the matter, I wish to assure Members that the Government are actively liaising with organisations conducting clinical trials to guarantee the uninterrupted supply and receipt of medicines. The Government are conducting a thorough review of clinical trial supplies to obtain a detailed understanding of requirements and are establishing contingency measures should sponsors require them. These measures will include access to the same prioritised shipping channels designated for all other medicines.

As I stated in response to the hon. Member for Cambridge (Daniel Zeichner), the Government remain committed to maintaining the UK’s position as a leading location for science and innovation. Members should be aware of the Government’s intention to adopt the EU’s new clinical trials regulation as promptly as possible once it is enacted, subject to the usual parliamentary procedures.",None
"I would also like to emphasize that the German precedent, which some have suggested would automatically apply, does not do so. That precedent was established under a different treaty. It is important to recall that the German case partly depended on the fact that the West German constitution, acknowledged by the then EC treaty, asserted territorial jurisdiction over all of Germany—that the basic law was applicable throughout. This situation does not apply to Ireland now, as articles 2 and 3 were amended, appropriately and legitimately, in the context of the Good Friday agreement. These matters should not be confused, particularly given the developments Brexit will bring in the coming years. Therefore, it is necessary to address these issues carefully at this stage. This concern was not raised solely by the Taoiseach last summer; it is evident that the Joint Oireachtas Committee of the Dáil and the Seanad are also giving it priority, and I understand it will be included in one of the Committee’s forthcoming reports.",None

"The enhancements made by the House of Commons to the Bill cover various aspects, including limiting the categories of deficiencies that may be addressed through the delegated powers contained in the Bill, as well as strengthening individual rights by extending the timeframe to initiate certain challenges under the general principles to three months following exit day. I will sequentially discuss the principal matters within this group on which the House of Lords has requested this House to reconsider, but where their approach has either compromised the fundamental intent of the Bill or sought to override carefully considered amendments previously agreed upon by this House.

The first topic concerns the sifting mechanism introduced in this House by my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker), who serves as the Chair of our Procedure Committee. The proposal involved establishing a committee to review instruments subject to the negative procedure, which are made under the primary powers in the Bill, with the ability to recommend that such instruments be subjected to the affirmative procedure instead. This recommendation was unanimously supported by the cross-party Procedure Committee following thorough and detailed examination, and the Government agreed to accept it. The amendments put forward by my hon. Friend were approved by this House after comprehensive debate.",None
"Thirdly, these regulations modify the current UK-wide enforcement provisions to ensure their applicability within Great Britain and reaffirm the EU CPR enforcement provisions as they pertain to Northern Ireland. In Great Britain, the regulations update the enforcement framework to acknowledge that the CE marking alone, as well as the CE marking accompanied by UK(NI) indicators, will be accepted. For Northern Ireland, the regulations establish an enforcement system concerning the EU construction products legislation alongside the newly introduced UK(NI) marking.

Lastly, the regulations introduce a limited number of technical adjustments aimed at rectifying shortcomings in the 2019 regulations that emerged following the UK's departure from the EU, in line with the withdrawal agreement and the Northern Ireland protocol.",None
"Very well. If we are reflecting on past events, I believe it is appropriate to inform the hon. Lady that between 1999 and 2009 I served not in this House but in the European Parliament. During that period, I was a member of the budget and budgetary control committees, observing that Labour Members of Parliament and Labour Ministers at the time did not pay much attention to EU expenditure. Therefore, I welcome the current shift in approach, as it is important to concentrate on this matter.",None
"Secondly, I consider it important to note that the House’s decision today, when it approved the amendment and then approved the motion as amended, was explicitly that approval would be withheld “unless and until” the legislative stages necessary for implementation had been completed. This current action clearly contradicts that position, as it seeks the House’s approval prior to the completion of those legislative stages.

I fully understand the Government’s rationale for this approach, as it effectively undermines the impact of today’s amendment instead of progressing us to the Second Reading of the withdrawal implementation Bill, which was my expectation and intention. However, I felt it necessary to highlight these points to you, Mr Speaker, as they are relevant considerations in determining whether the process is orderly.",None

"I must tell the Secretary of State that I found his clarification somewhat unclear and not entirely persuasive. In the proposed new paragraph 11B of clause 4, concerning the authority of the Scottish Parliament, it is evident that the devolved Administrations lack the power to legislate beyond their devolved competencies. Since it is inherent in devolution that these Administrations do not possess such powers, I would suggest to the Secretary of State that the inclusion of this clause is, at the very least, somewhat redundant. He will need to provide a more satisfactory explanation than he did to the hon. and learned Lady regarding why a similar provision is necessary or unnecessary in relation to the powers of this House.",None
"My right hon. Friend is accurate in stating that a commencement order is necessary pursuant to section 25(4) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 to implement the repeal. The scheduling of that commencement order will be determined by the date on which we exit the EU. The repeal of the 1972 Act must be commenced on the day of our departure, which is currently set for 12 April if the deal is not agreed, or 22 May if the deal receives approval.",None
"We were informed that we would regain control and secure our sovereignty, and to achieve this, we must have input on the rules and standards governing us—to act as rule makers rather than rule takers. These expressions have been frequently used in recent years, and the amendments returning from the Lords today will accomplish exactly that—granting our sovereign Parliament influence over any trade agreements negotiated by the Executive.

While part of the European Union, our MEPs were guaranteed a debate and vote in the European Parliament on every trade deal, with the power to reject any agreement considered unacceptable. Why should we now settle for reduced influence within this Parliament? Our constituents expect proper representation.

"Ministers may argue, “What about the time factor? All these alternative proposals will require time.” When there is a war or national emergency, this House has expedited the passage of Bills.

Executives of various political affiliations—even coalitions—have, through the Whip system, effectively limited this House’s involvement in some significant decisions. This is most evident in the way Government spending decisions are debated. Members may find it notable that the last occasion this House rejected a spending request from the Executive was in 1919, when it turned down funding for the then Lord Chancellor’s bathroom.

Greater clarity on this matter would be appreciated not only by the Prime Minister’s own Back Benchers but also by many citizens throughout the nation.

"In fact, it is neither of those things, but this dispute highlights the ongoing and dynamic nature of the relationship between Parliament, the Government, and the public. This relationship is in a state of continuous development within our constitutional framework, and two particular pieces of legislation have brought about significant changes in the interaction between Parliament and the Government. The first is the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011, which was introduced to this House, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, as a means to restrict Executive authority. However, when a statutory vote of no confidence occurs, the Act does not specify the subsequent course of action beyond a 14-day timeframe. While the Prime Minister can no longer unilaterally call a general election, they are also not required to resign immediately—at least not within those 14 days. This provision effectively reinforces the position of the sitting Prime Minister. This outcome was, of course, deliberate—it aimed to maintain the coalition government—but it has resulted in Parliament having the capacity to weaken Governments without necessarily removing them.

"I will address Brexit in more detail later; however, I wish to first raise an issue requiring immediate consideration, which we have previously discussed with the Immigration Minister—specifically, the presence of non-European Economic Area crew members on the Scottish fishing fleet. This concerns not unskilled workers, as is sometimes assumed, but rather skilled and qualified fishermen. Similar to agriculture, a sector with which I am familiar from my upbringing, fishing is a profession that demands dedication and enthusiasm to succeed. Additionally, like farming, it is often a vocation passed down through generations. Many fishermen are raised within fishing communities, whether in coastal towns such as Peterhead, Fraserburgh, or Macduff within my constituency, or in places such as the Philippines or other countries.

The industry acknowledges the necessity for a transition towards a sustainable local workforce; however, this will require time due primarily to the need to reverse the long-standing impacts of overarching EU policies, such as the Common Fisheries Policy.

According to the proposed arrangement, Scottish fish exports to the European Union would be subject to significant tariffs. Any arrangement permitting Scottish vessels registered in Northern Ireland to land their catches there and subsequently transport them to the Republic of Ireland for processing to avoid these tariffs would present a major threat to Scotland’s fishing ports and the broader processing sector. This is the actual impact of the actions the Conservatives are proposing for our fishing industry. Such measures would put thousands of jobs at risk and could result in the fishing sector being among the most affected by Brexit across Scotland—once again, the Scottish fishing industry is compromised by the Conservatives. This is the factual situation, in contrast to the rhetoric of a UK Conservative Government that consistently regards Scotland as secondary. The SNP will not accept this.",Human Impact

"This Bill serves primarily as a framework. It has the backing of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation and provides greater scope for action both within the House of Commons and the devolved Administrations.

For many years—spanning several decades—fishing communities in Moray, including Cullen, Findochty, Buckie, and Burghead, have experienced a decline in fishing activity nationwide due to the constraints imposed by the common fisheries policy. This policy has significantly impacted industries that have been vital to numerous towns and villages across the country, leading to severe setbacks in many such areas. The current legislation offers an opportunity to begin rebuilding: restoring the fishing industry, the fleet, the workforce, and the volume of catches, along with their significance to local communities, reflecting the state of those industries in past decades.

As the House continues its discussion on the Queen’s Speech, it is increasingly clear that one consequence of a Conservative Brexit will be significant challenges for Britain’s National Health Service.

The NHS represents one of our most valuable national institutions; it was established through the collaboration of progressive and forward-thinking individuals in the previous century, providing healthcare accessible to all based on need rather than financial capacity. However, in the current century, the NHS faces serious threats due to a harmful mix of prolonged underinvestment and the impact of leaving the EU, while also contending with challenges that differ greatly from those it faced at its inception.

Despite the statements made in the Queen’s Speech, it must be emphasized that the NHS is not being allocated the funding required for it to function effectively. This issue was addressed just yesterday in the Health and Social Care Committee, where we heard from the Secretary of State regarding an existing backlog of £6 billion in NHS maintenance alone. Therefore, an announcement covering only half of that amount cannot be regarded as a significant achievement. Additionally, the Health Foundation provided its evaluation of the funding outlined in the Queen’s Speech, noting that...",Human Impact
"I am unable to yield further time as many Members wish to contribute.

It is clear that significant dissatisfaction among working-class voters influenced the Brexit decision, with concerns around migration and free movement being prominent. My right hon. and learned Friend representing Holborn and St Pancras outlined several issues we can tackle, and the former Prime Minister Gordon Brown highlighted additional points in his address last week. There are measures within our reach, and addressing working-class concerns is necessary; however, initiating this process by supporting a course that would reduce our nation’s wealth and limit the resources needed for public services, regeneration, housing, and improved opportunities for working-class communities is not the correct approach.",Human Impact
"There have been no new developments in the negotiations, and the Ministers have not provided any additional information on the matter. Instead, the Government appears willing to allow the wider population to face rising food prices at a time when many already rely on food banks, experience shortages in medical supplies that will affect the most vulnerable, and witness further strain on public services that have suffered under a decade of austerity, limiting educational and employment prospects for younger generations compared to previous ones.

Members of Parliament should be fully committed to supporting and safeguarding these individuals, as this is a fundamental principle of our democratic system. This aggressive political strategy risks causing long-term harm across the UK and Europe, with the most significant impact on people within the United Kingdom. It is possible to prevent this outcome now through legislative action, which we owe to those most at risk and those who will bear the greatest consequences.",Human Impact
"Over the weekend, the Home Secretary was sent a letter from representatives of the police, religious communities, and various civil society groups outlining significant worries regarding the proposed Bill. It would be inappropriate for her to disregard these concerns and proceed without consideration. The Prevent duty, which requires reporting extremist conduct, is causing a perception among the Muslim community that they are being unfairly singled out and subjected to surveillance. This is fostering an atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust. From my perspective, should the Government proceed with legislation that broadens what is seen as a restrictive and discriminatory policy, it may not address extremism effectively and could instead create conditions conducive to its growth.",Human Impact
"Discussions on this topic should begin with the recognition that immigration from the EU has positively impacted this country and that the contributions made by EU nationals will continue to benefit the nation regardless of their stance on Brexit. Evidence of this is readily available. For instance, in the realm of sports just last week, we witnessed the remarkable abilities of Emma Raducanu, an 18-year-old British tennis player who advanced to the last 16 at Wimbledon. Born to a Romanian father and a Chinese mother and raised in the UK, she has impressed many with her athletic skill, achievements, and promise. Similarly, the football teams representing all the home nations have been strengthened by the influence of immigration. A notable example shared on social media by the Migration Museum highlighted that eight of the starting eleven players in the England team that recently defeated Germany were either children or grandchildren of immigrants to the UK, underscoring the significant role immigration has played.",Human Impact
"Regarding social care and our hospitals, I appreciate the modest additional funding outlined in the Budget; however, many Members, including myself, experience local challenges. Currently, hospital beds are available in both Honiton and Seaton, but there is a plan to remove these beds from both locations. This would result in an area of about 100 square miles without any hospital beds. Those managing the health service must acknowledge the large geographical size of Devon and the distances people must travel to reach hospitals, including visitors going to see family members. Cottage hospitals play a valuable role in alleviating some of the demand on acute hospitals, so it is important to secure funding for them. While providing care in people’s homes is necessary, hospital care remains essential as well.",Human Impact

Voters considered more than procedural details or structures; they reflected on the broader context of their everyday lives.

Politics extends beyond mere transactions; it encompasses all aspects. Labour proposes a plan aimed at tackling inequality, division, and poverty, while ending austerity measures. It seeks to mend the fractured nation and restore connections with the EU and other partners, offering genuine hope and stability.

"Today, we heard contributions from my honourable colleagues the Members for Banff and Buchan (David Duguid), West Aberdeenshire and Kincardine (Andrew Bowie), Bury St Edmunds (Jo Churchill), Solihull (Julian Knight), Stirling (Stephen Kerr), and Gordon (Colin Clark), each presenting the perspectives of their constituents, some of whose areas voted to leave the EU. I would also like to highlight my honourable colleague and neighbour from Lincolnshire, the Member for Boston and Skegness (Matt Warman), who represents a constituency with one of the largest Eastern European populations in the country. He clearly articulated the views of his constituents, including both those born locally and those who have chosen to settle there from the European Union.

Since the outcome of last summer’s referendum, the Government have consistently emphasised the urgency of securing the status of EU citizens residing here at the earliest opportunity. As the Prime Minister stated in her open letter to EU citizens, this is her primary focus in the negotiations. The entitlement to settled status will be established within the withdrawal agreement and subsequently enacted through legislation in the United Kingdom.",Human Impact
"Clare Short, the former International Development Secretary who established DFID, and I provided testimony to the Select Committee regarding challenges that agencies sometimes encounter. These agencies can be unintentionally impacted by counter-terrorism regulations, which hinder their critical humanitarian efforts. Operating in areas without effective law enforcement presents challenges, often requiring engagement with individuals involved in illicit activities. The Bill proposed under the Foreign Secretary’s leadership aims to clarify the position for donors working through NGOs and for financial institutions concerned about compliance with the rules. It seeks to address the issue of banks withdrawing services—known as de-risking—where NGOs have reportedly struggled to access bank accounts or transfer funds due to fears of violating sanctions. The Bill is intended to alleviate such concerns among banks, support transport and logistics firms, facilitate NGO access to legitimate banking services, and minimize or remove issues related to remittances, which, as Members on both sides are aware, represent a significantly larger flow of resources to developing countries than official international aid.",Human Impact

The Prime Minister initially declared the construction of 40 new hospitals, a figure that was reduced to six shortly thereafter.

Numerous honourable Members from both sides of the House have mentioned these concerns during today’s discussion.",Human Impact

The TUC has stated that it cannot endorse an agreement that does not secure rights at work, employment, and stability in Northern Ireland. It has highlighted the inadequacies of the Political Declaration and noted that it lacks legal enforceability. Workers have no clear understanding of what the UK’s future relationship with the EU will entail or how it will affect their lives. The sole certainty appears to be that this Brexit agreement will result in economic decline, as evidenced by the Government’s own economic projections, which predict a GDP reduction of approximately 3.9% and negative impacts across all UK regions.",Human Impact
"The former Prime Minister referred to ending the safety culture. However, anyone who had been outside Wembley stadium, where around 1,000 workers gathered to mourn a colleague who had recently died in a workplace accident, would not speak of ending the safety culture in such terms.

"The issue is that reciprocal healthcare is not an independent provision; rather, it exists solely to support the right to freedom of movement. Individuals are unable to fully exercise their freedom of movement if they cannot afford healthcare in the locations where they choose to live, work, form relationships, establish residence, or retire. For several decades, there has been the ability to retire and settle in various places. Many are familiar with my husband’s circumstances as a German national residing here who has spent nearly his entire adult life employed within our health service. This was certainly his primary concern following the Brexit referendum, and I believe it is a shared concern among the 5 million people who have either settled here from European countries or moved from the UK to Europe.",Human Impact
"I will keep my remarks concise, as we are approaching an important phase in the proceedings.

Like many honourable Members, especially those in Opposition, I voted to remain in the European Union. Similarly, I was actively engaged within my constituency and across the West Midlands to advocate for that position, particularly among the manufacturers and traders for which the area is known. I was, as many others were, disappointed that the referendum result went the opposite way. The overall result of 48% to 52% was fairly close, but in Coventry specifically, 60% voted to leave and 40% to remain.

When the matter of triggering Article 50 came before the House, I had little doubt—we must respect a clear democratic decision—and so we proceeded accordingly. Nevertheless, I expressed at that time two essential conditions that I believed necessary to mitigate the most severe consequences of Brexit: the need for a transitional period to implement new arrangements, and those arrangements should be as flexible as possible. I maintain that these points remain valid today. I agreed to observe how the Government might progress on these matters, but regrettably, there has been little noticeable advancement either within the UK or among our European counterparts.",Human Impact
"For instance, a French national residing in the UK, married to a British citizen and with children attending school or university here, will be ineligible to vote in the referendum. In contrast, individuals from the Republic of Ireland, Malta, or Cyprus will have the right to vote. This is because Malta and Cyprus are members of the Commonwealth, and Commonwealth citizens, along with British nationals, are permitted to vote in parliamentary elections. Due to longstanding arrangements with the Republic of Ireland, which is not part of the Commonwealth, Irish citizens are also entitled to vote in parliamentary elections and to stand for Parliament in the UK. The provisions in the Bill result in the exclusion of people who have established families and roots in the UK from participating in the vote on whether to separate the UK from their European country of origin, while allowing certain non-British individuals to take part in the referendum.",Human Impact
"I will be supporting the Prime Minister’s agreement today because, according to businesses in the West Midlands that employ thousands of my constituents, it is “good enough”—sufficient for us to leave the EU and succeed independently. While it may not be flawless, those advocating for alternative plans should consider the challenges faced by industry. This is not the moment to oppose the practical options currently available. I acknowledge my right hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for his insight on this matter.

At present, what businesses require is clarity. With only 73 days remaining before the UK exits the EU, companies are already making expensive choices to stockpile materials and components, and in some cases, to suspend production temporarily. These costs impact their profitability and can lead to job losses. The automotive sector, which relies heavily on the EU as its main market, is especially affected. It is important to note that many of its workers come from some of the most economically disadvantaged areas of the UK. While some colleagues may not yet have experienced job losses in their constituencies, the West Midlands certainly has.",Human Impact
"We have already heard, and will hear once more today, about the friends, family members, colleagues, and constituents from other member states who are currently facing uncertainty regarding their future. Similarly, we have heard, and will hear again, about the valued employees, essential personnel, and crucial public service workers from other EU countries whose future now appears unclear. Expecting individuals to live under such uncertainty is unacceptable. This treatment of our EU citizens is wholly inappropriate.

On Monday, the Minister conveyed genuine sympathy towards many of these concerns, and it is evident from his remarks that he aims to achieve a situation where EU citizens can and will remain in the country. However, sympathy and hopeful statements alone are insufficient. Immediate clarity and reassurance are necessary and are both possible and appropriate to provide.

The Government’s reasons for withholding such clarity are unreasonable and perplexing. On Monday, the Minister expressed discomfort—he remains uncomfortable today—with the use of phrases like “bargaining chip,” yet he himself acknowledged that securing the status of EU migrants in the UK, along with that of UK citizens in the EU, “needs to be part of the negotiations.”—[Official Report, 4 July 2016; Vol. 612, c. 616.]",Human Impact
"I must proceed promptly to allow time for those seated on the Treasury Bench.

Regarding the Windrush issue, the Government needs to recognise the extent of disappointment and fear experienced by the Windrush individuals. It appears that, because many are elderly, the Government may believe that prolonging the process is acceptable—[Interruption.] That seems to be the case; I suggest they meet with some of these individuals—[Interruption.] The Home Secretary’s response has not been sufficiently swift, and it seems that only a Labour administration would deliver justice for the Windrush generation.

I noted the Home Secretary’s remarks on border protection; however, upon leaving the EU, the UK would lose access to the European arrest warrant and important criminal and missing persons databases, along with the cooperative benefits currently enjoyed as EU members. Therefore, it may be premature to emphasise border protection when some key tools aiding the Government in maintaining public safety will be lost.",Human Impact
"To conclude, new clause 18 addresses migration levels. The political declaration confirms the intention to end free movement. This presents a considerable challenge, which the SNP has consistently opposed. While we do not support the UK’s departure from the EU, if the UK proceeds with leaving and establishing its own immigration policy, it must avoid a £30,000 salary threshold and allow individuals to come to live and work in Scotland. Should the UK Government be unwilling to implement such measures, they ought to transfer these powers to Scotland so that it can manage immigration accordingly, or alternatively, Scotland should be given the opportunity to pursue independence again to establish an improved immigration system.

The demographic trend in Scotland shows an ageing population at a faster rate than the rest of the UK. Across the UK, EU nationals make up 15% of the workforce in the agriculture and food industries. However, in my constituency, I have engaged with a local business where EU nationals constitute over half the employees. Scotland’s overall international migrant population stands at 7%, with the proportion of residents born outside the UK being notably higher in Aberdeen.",Human Impact
"Benefit payments are not increasing in line with inflation. The Chancellor’s pledge to increase benefits by 10.1% next year represents progress; however, the question remains: how are individuals coping this winter? How are they keeping their homes warm and securing enough food? Financial support is needed immediately. I have also encountered remarks suggesting that “people need to improve their budget management.” To clarify, when someone is operating on a very limited budget and is fully aware of every source of income and every expenditure, they are already highly skilled at managing their finances. If Members wish to understand effective budgeting, they should engage with the most economically vulnerable people in their constituencies, as these individuals have practical experience in doing so.",Human Impact
"The Government’s efforts to undermine the Lords amendment will fail for several reasons that have already been explained. I tell the Solicitor General that, quite honestly, time is limited, and therefore this is the critical moment to make a decision. Furthermore, as has been clearly highlighted, the amendment does not address the scenario of a no-deal outcome. The House recognises the implications that a no-deal situation would have on the Northern Ireland border, trade, the rights of British nationals overseas and EU nationals in the UK, future security collaboration, and various other issues.",Human Impact
"The Government will likely argue that the effects on the creative sectors and individuals’ capacity to obtain visas for work travel, supported by an effective immigration system, will be governed by reciprocal agreements with the EU. However, for those in the creative fields, this situation is not a matter of one side gaining at the expense of another. There are mutual benefits if EU citizens can work in the UK, such as contributions from renowned orchestras and artists whose work is exhibited in our galleries.

Consequently, clarity is needed now regarding the Government’s plans, and it is important to establish new clause 37 to enable monitoring of the consequences of their policies. I ask the Minister: what future do they anticipate for our creative industries? What forms of reciprocity do they expect concerning social security provisions and other practical constraints affecting those employed in the creative and artistic sectors working in other parts of Europe? How do they intend to support the capacity of some of our leading artists, musicians, and creatives to operate across the continent, as well as the ability of their counterparts to work within the UK?

While I acknowledge the assistance provided under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, it does not fully address the issue. On 7 May, a High Court decision was made in favour of an eight-year-old British boy, supported by his migrant mother, finding that the policy preventing families in similar situations from accessing welfare protections violated article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

"Earlier this week, the Government released their Environment Bill. While some aspects were positively received, there was a lack of detail regarding the Government’s seemingly ambitious air quality objectives. Given the Government’s frequent assertions that leaving the European Union presents an opportunity to implement improved legislation, why have they not clearly stated that provisions within one of their key Bills will surpass current EU standards? Why has the chance to adopt the more stringent World Health Organization standards not been taken? Furthermore, why does the proposed new regulatory body appear to scale back enforcement mechanisms, such as financial penalties? The Government should not transfer responsibility onto local authorities while simultaneously reducing their funding, thereby avoiding challenging choices.

The Government’s actions are neither sufficient nor swift enough to enhance air quality and safeguard children’s health. I have participated in marches, attended events, and spoken at various forums on climate change and air quality within my constituency. This issue is one of great concern. Frequently, it is young people, the next generation, who are advocating most strongly for cleaner air. We should facilitate their efforts.",Human Impact
"Most pressingly, this requires a comprehensive overhaul of the city's transport system to reduce congestion caused by private vehicles and improve the speed of bus and rail services. The Beeching cuts did not merely make minor reductions in Stoke-on-Trent’s rail infrastructure; they resulted in widespread closures. Numerous branch lines were discontinued and many stations shut down, with the situation further deteriorating over time. For example, the Strategic Rail Authority closed Etruria station as recently as 2005 and removed it entirely in 2008. Stoke-on-Trent is in urgent need of enhanced public transport options. It is essential that the city secures a significant portion of funding from the transforming cities fund, the bus fund, the reverse Beeching fund, and other sources to address the long-term underinvestment that has left the area without its appropriate share. I hope Stoke-on-Trent will be selected as a pilot location for the superbus initiative, as its unique composition of six towns within one city could serve as an effective model for other areas.",Human Impact

It is likely that all Members agree on the importance of the Government making every effort to ensure that all individuals eligible to apply for settled status through the EU settlement scheme are made aware of it. There is a significant and justified concern that children in care from the EEA and Switzerland might be overlooked. According to the Home Office, approximately 5,000 looked-after children and 4,000 care leavers in the UK will need to submit applications under the EU settlement scheme.

"That is acceptable, but within my west London constituency, many individuals can only aspire to having a place to live, let alone owning one. Both younger and older people are often unable to move out of their parents’ homes. Families reside in substandard temporary housing that is barely affordable, and they face constant uncertainty about having to relocate—sometimes repeatedly over several years. Their situation offers little prospect of improvement. The Red Book accurately notes that average house prices in London are twelve times the average worker’s income, but it also states:

“The only sustainable way to make housing more affordable over the long term is to build more homes in the right places.”

There is no concrete evidence indicating that constructing additional homes in London would reduce prices within the current imbalanced housing market.

Numerous aspects of the Bill’s drafting demonstrate a clear emphasis on environmental issues, which is commendable. The Secretary of State and his team at DEFRA have received appropriate recognition from environmental groups for their strong advocacy on environmental matters. Nonetheless, it is important to ensure that an environmental perspective primarily shaped by London-based non-governmental organisations is not imposed on the rest of the country.

"Universal credit remains a significant issue. According to the Children’s Society, despite the additional funding announced in the Budget, the reduction in work allowances under universal credit, which was introduced in April 2016, will result in families losing approximately £2,460 annually. I continue to have concerns regarding the structure of universal credit, as it is leading to numerous practical and frustrating difficulties for many of my constituents. For instance, one constituent, a single parent working 25 hours a week as a cleaner and caring for a young child in primary school, experienced a change in circumstances and was transitioned onto universal credit. Due to an error in processing her claim, there was a delay in her initial payment, forcing her to use a food bank. Although she received an advance payment, the final settlement of her claim has left her with insufficient funds to cover living expenses after rent is paid. Her financial situation has deteriorated since moving from tax credits to universal credit.

This is because, as mentioned earlier, they have experienced unfavorable outcomes over the years due to ineffective negotiations by the UK Government concerning the common fisheries policy—negotiations from which Scottish Government Ministers have been excluded. The key benefit of this compromise plan for fishermen is that although it involves exiting the common fisheries policy, they would retain access to the single market.

As a result, they were compelled to leave their home and depend on universal credit. They asked me, “Why am I being treated unfairly as a taxpaying citizen? It is not my fault that self-employment is the logical choice in my profession.” Indeed, why?

During the pandemic, there was an additional setback—the end of visa-free travel. This was a severe blow for many performers.

The fact remains that if the terms of an agreement are altered, then people are entitled to reconsider the original decision, are they not? I would have thought that to be a reasonable position. If someone purchases an item from a store that promises certain features, and upon opening the package at home finds it does not match those promises, they are entitled to return the product. Similarly, we should be allowed to reconsider our position.

I would like to continue at greater length, Madam Deputy Speaker, but I understand you prefer I do not. Returning to my initial point, I wish to discuss how Brexit relates to this debate concerning the resilience or otherwise of the Union and to Scottish self-governance. Recent developments have significantly undermined the Union by weakening the devolution settlement that might have provided it with some robustness two decades ago. This is occurring in three respects. Firstly, for the first time in our history, the UK Government is resolved to disregard the Sewel convention and to enact legislation on matters devolved to the Scottish Parliament without its approval. [Interruption.] That is an unfortunate reality, and it is unproductive for Scottish Conservative Members to dispute it.",Powerlessness
"A sanctions policy that is both effective and focused is an important instrument. Sanctions have contributed to resolving complex and significant policy challenges—for instance, by encouraging Iran to enter negotiations and agree to strict limitations on its nuclear activities. The United Kingdom currently administers 34 sanctions programmes, approximately half of which arise from legally binding United Nations Security Council resolutions, with the remainder stemming from additional actions coordinated with European Union partners. It is necessary to maintain the capacity to impose, modify, and remove sanctions regimes to fulfill our international commitments and to advance our broader foreign policy and national security goals following our departure from the European Union.

The outcome of last year’s referendum clearly indicated the desire of the people of the United Kingdom to alter our relationship with the European Union and regain control over our legislation. The Government is acting on this mandate through ongoing negotiations—now entering their second phase—and by introducing key legislation such as the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill, which was published by the Government last week.",Powerlessness
"I concur with my honourable Friend. It is essential that Northern Ireland’s perspective is adequately represented through the appropriate mechanisms within the Brexit proceedings, which necessitates the presence of a devolved Government.",Powerlessness
"I appreciate the Minister’s confirmation regarding the ECJ. The electorate in Heywood and Middleton expressed their preference to leave the European Union by a substantial majority. Would he concur that the primary motivation behind this was the desire to regain authority over our legislation here, rather than being governed by decisions from Brussels?",Powerlessness
"Currently, the highest authority in the United Kingdom is the European Court of Justice; it serves as the final arbiter for any legal matter and has the power to overturn decisions made by both Houses of Parliament, repeal statutes, and invalidate laws enacted by this institution. This situation was deemed unsatisfactory by the majority of the British public. When they voted many years ago to remain part of the European Economic Community, then referred to as the Common Market and inaccurately described as a free trade area—which differs significantly from a customs union with intricate regulations—they were assured that their Parliament would retain the ability to set taxes, allocate funds, and enact legislation in the usual manner. This assurance ultimately proved to be incorrect.",Powerlessness
"Central to the referendum on the European Union is the issue of democracy and the democratic shortfall. I would like to highlight the report from the European Scrutiny Committee published this morning, which addresses the absence of a democratic framework within the Council of Ministers. The electorate is seeking clear information ahead of the referendum. Approximately 55% of our legislation originates from the European Union, mostly created by officials and subsequently approved by Ministers, yet there is a lack of transparency regarding how about half of the decisions made in private are determined, as noted in the unanimous findings of the European Scrutiny Committee. What processes govern these decisions, and what are the implications? Could the Deputy Leader of the House arrange a debate on this issue?",Powerlessness
"In my conversations within the European Union, both with EU leaders and the European Commission, it has been made clear that they approach these negotiations with the aim of resolving the matter highlighted by this House and reiterated by the right hon. Gentleman. Specifically, the goal is to secure a legally binding amendment that provides assurance that the concern raised regarding the potentially indefinite application of the backstop is properly addressed and settled. This is the focus of our current efforts. I acknowledge the right hon. Gentleman’s consistent emphasis on the necessity for an appropriate legal framework for this amendment, and that is precisely what we are striving to achieve.",Powerlessness
"It is essential to prevent the disorder that such divergence could cause. For this reason, I am against the proposed amendments to clause 10 and schedule 2 that aim to expand the delegated powers granted to the devolved Administrations. The Bill does not represent a power grab; it reflects practical reasoning. Nevertheless, it is crucial that the devolved Administrations possess suitable delegated powers to amend legislation, ensuring its continued operation post-Brexit. The primary objective of the Bill is to maintain the statute book and reduce disruption.

Granting delegated powers to the devolved Administrations follows logically from our devolution arrangement and the reality that, as within Westminster, adjustments in Holyrood, Cardiff Bay, and eventually Stormont cannot be achieved solely through primary legislation. As the Minister highlighted, it is vital that these powers are sufficiently extensive to allow the devolved Administrations to implement appropriate modifications, rather than being limited to minimal changes that would leave the statute book barely operational. The goal is to have a fully functional statute book after Brexit, rather than one that is only partially effective.",Powerlessness
"I welcome the report, though I am concerned about the manner in which Russia is sometimes discussed in the House, particularly when the experiences of communities within Russia, who live under the daily realities of the Russian state, are not acknowledged.

It is now apparent that the Russian Federation perceives the United Kingdom’s global influence as significantly diminished, not only due to the matters outlined in the Committee’s report but also because of Brexit. Does the right hon. Gentleman agree that the Committee’s failure to examine the impact of Brexit was a shortcoming, and that this omission may reinforce the Kremlin’s belief that the United Kingdom lacks a clear strategy in collaborating with like-minded European countries to address the serious threats posed by the Russian Federation?",Powerlessness
"I am pleased to offer a brief contribution to this significant discussion. I intend to support the motion this evening, as it is evident to me that the sole resolution to the present circumstances is a general election. This House is at an impasse. Progress is halted. We are unable to advance with Brexit or any other matter. This situation is detrimental to the nation. It is also harmful to the businesses within our country, which are frustrated by the ongoing uncertainty and difficulties they encounter and seek clarity on the future direction. The current condition of this House is not beneficial for our democratic process.",Powerlessness
"Another point concerns the Competition and Markets Authority. I recall hearing many Brexiteer colleagues express strong opposition to unelected officials—those often-discussed figures from the past. It turns out they are not located in an office in Brussels; instead, they operate within the Cabinet Office. They are not referred to as the European Commission; rather, they are known as the Competition and Markets Authority, and this body will be responsible for overseeing all matters related to devolution and determining the scope of actions available to the Scottish Government.",Powerlessness
"Could my right hon. Friend confirm whether he concurs with the Treasury's projection released on Monday, indicating that remaining in the European Union could result in an additional 3 million migrants by 2030? In the previous year, both my right hon. Friend and I were elected on a distinct manifesto commitment to lower net migration to the tens of thousands. How can this commitment be fulfilled without exiting the European Union?",Powerlessness
"Attempting to influence the motor insurance sector is understandable; however, it is crucial for the industry to recognize that the Bill is advancing, which is why the £50 increase has not been applied. If the Bill is not enacted, that increase will occur. This does not mean that individuals will see their motor insurance premiums decrease by £50 annually, but rather that they will avoid an increase of £50 per year. My honourable Friend can proceed with renewing his motor insurance.

To the best of my knowledge, if enacted, this Bill will represent the first Act of Parliament to repeal retained EU legislation. Additionally, it will be the first to eliminate retained EU case law, marking a significant step in regaining authority over our own legal framework. This is one of the evident benefits of exiting the European Union, allowing Parliament to amend laws to ensure they are interpreted in accordance with the intentions of this sovereign body.",Powerlessness
"Temporary protection status will be granted solely to individuals with successful claims who entered the country unlawfully and cannot be removed. This status does not grant an automatic right to remain permanently, as individuals will undergo regular reviews for potential removal. The status provides restricted access to benefits and limited rights for family reunification. Additionally, the new measures will introduce maximum life sentences for those involved in people smuggling and facilitation; implement new regulations to prevent fraudulent claims of being minors; and enhance the enforcement capabilities of Border Force.",Powerlessness
"This method ensures maximum legal clarity from the outset, although our aim is not to permanently fix the previous rulings of the European Court of Justice. Accordingly, the Bill will stipulate that case law from the European Court will hold the same authority in our courts as rulings from the Supreme Court. While the Supreme Court seldom overturns its own judgments, it does occasionally do so. We anticipate that the Supreme Court will adopt a similarly cautious approach when considering departing from European Court of Justice case law, yet we consider it appropriate that the Court has the ability to do so. Naturally, Parliament retains the authority to amend the law and, if deemed necessary, to overturn case law.",Powerlessness
"I pledged to the voters that I would honour the devolution arrangements within our nation, and I intend to do so. The Bill will be passed to repeal and replace the European Communities Act 1972. Since 1972, significant developments have occurred, including the establishment of devolved Administrations through referendums and legislation enacted by this sovereign Parliament. When referring to legislators reclaiming authority, it means exactly that—multiple legislative bodies. The powers of those Assemblies and of Parliament must be safeguarded, yet the Bill fails to ensure this. It mentions consultation and dialogue but does not commit to upholding the authority of the devolved Administrations.",Powerlessness
"The hon. Gentleman has consistently supported the roles and authorities of Parliament; however, he quickly diverges into discussing the longstanding nature of our relationship with the EU. The key issue here is how that relationship is set to evolve. It is clear that changes will occur following the referendum and article 50 negotiations, but it is our collective duty to decide the manner of those changes. The hon. Gentleman, along with all other Members of this House, is aware that granting powers through secondary legislation centralizes authority with Ministers and typically undergoes less rigorous examination. Additionally, the matter extends beyond the concentration of power under clause 9 to include the procedure the Government intends to follow in making decisions about the withdrawal agreement, which will activate clause 9.",Powerlessness
"May I also align myself with the views so clearly articulated by colleagues from both sides of the Chamber?

Contrary to suggestions by some, those of us who supported leaving were fully aware of the implications of our decision. We voted to manage our own immigration, allocate our financial resources independently, legislate autonomously, and have those laws interpreted by our own judiciary. The current position of the Labour party seems to be in favour of a second referendum. Could my right hon. Friend clarify whether, during his tenure and that of the Prime Minister, a second referendum will be ruled out? A simple yes or no would suffice.",Powerlessness
"On 23 June of the previous year, I cast my vote, alongside over 1 million Scottish citizens and more than 17 million individuals across Britain, in favour of departing the European Union. This choice was made after careful consideration; the portrayal of those who voted to leave as idealistic enthusiasts unconcerned with economic implications is inaccurate. The decision to leave the EU is grounded in practical reasoning, and I am of the view that the United Kingdom will be in a stronger position and face fewer risks by managing its own affairs and engaging in trade with global partners, rather than remaining increasingly dependent on the changing circumstances and policies of the European Union.",Powerlessness
"Allow me to state without ambiguity: the legal rights currently held by workers will remain protected under the law—and this protection will persist for the duration of my tenure as Prime Minister.

While this is a positive initial statement, I continue to have reservations that the Government’s conduct may not be fully consistent with this declared position.

I am especially troubled by a written response provided last week to an inquiry from the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook). When questioned about the Government’s approach to implementing the agency workers directive domestically via the so-called great repeal Bill, the Minister of State for the Department for Exiting the European Union, the right hon. Member for Clwyd West (Mr Jones), stated:

“The Bill will convert existing European Union law into domestic law, wherever practical.”

How does the phrase “wherever practical” align with the firm commitment made by the Prime Minister on this broader matter only a few weeks ago? What specific practical challenges have the Government identified to date concerning the domestic implementation of these essential rights? Which worker protections currently established in the UK are now potentially vulnerable due to these practical considerations? Can the Minister provide clarification on these points today?",Powerlessness
"Ministers may argue, “What about the time involved? All these alternative options require time.” However, when there is a war or a national emergency, this House can pass Bills swiftly. At present, there is no war or national emergency; therefore, there is sufficient time for us, as committed democrats, to carefully consider the matter and ensure it is handled correctly. The Government’s failure to do so is unacceptable.

The Bill’s method presents risks because parliamentary sovereignty in this country has long been fragile. It has remained fragile for many years. Governments of various political alignments—even, I might add, coalitions—have used the Whip system to prevent this House from fully engaging in some critical decisions. This is particularly evident in the manner in which the House discusses Government spending decisions. Members may find it noteworthy that the last occasion on which this House rejected a spending request from the Executive was in 1919, concerning funds for the bathroom of the then Lord Chancellor. Since that time, hundreds of billions of pounds have been approved without a formal vote against, reflecting the Executive’s limited commitment to parliamentary sovereignty.",Powerlessness
"I am pleased to return to the Chamber to address the Second Reading of this Bill, which will terminate the EU freedom of movement and introduce a new points-based immigration system that applies equally to all individuals. To be clear, I fully endorse this Bill. Regaining control over our borders was a key factor, if not the primary reason, why millions across the country chose to leave the European Union nearly four years ago. This Bill moves us closer to fulfilling that significant decision.",Powerlessness
"In light of recent weekend media coverage, which appears to have been well-informed, could the Prime Minister clarify whether the United Kingdom will continue to be a party to the European Convention on Human Rights and maintain the Human Rights Act 1998 without repeal? The Prime Minister’s lack of transparency has left uncertainty regarding the foundation of his negotiations. Frequently, information has been disseminated through unnamed briefings from his close advisors. I would like to address the Prime Minister directly: we intend to support the introduction of the proposed “red card” system, which aims to enhance the influence of national Parliaments over European legislation. Indeed, this proposal was included in Labour’s manifesto during the last general election. Does the Prime Minister concur with Angela Merkel, as we do on the Labour side, that

“there are aspects of European integration, such as the principles of free movement and non-discrimination, which are not subject to negotiation”?

Further clarification from the Prime Minister on this matter would be appreciated, likely not only by his own Back Benchers but also by millions across the nation.

We hold the view that increased international cooperation is necessary in areas including environmental and climate change concerns, workers’ rights, corporate regulation, and the prevention of tax avoidance.",Powerlessness
"I intend to vote to leave the European Union because of my affection for my country, while also acknowledging and respecting those who choose to remain, as they too act out of love for their nation; both perspectives are motivated by a desire to improve their country. My grandfather served in the First World War, and my father served in the Second World War, both aiming to secure democratic rights for nations within Europe and beyond. Devolution remains a fundamental aspect of British governance, aiming to bring decision-making closer to the populace. However, I hold the view that the top European leaders seem disconnected from ordinary citizens. Many people in this country, as well as across Europe, are unable to identify a single member of the European Commission. There are numerous such anonymous officials, many earning salaries significantly higher than that of the Prime Minister.",Powerlessness
"We are considering this legislation at a time when there remains uncertainty about the requirements that European negotiators will set out in these areas, meaning this Bill is effectively “virtual” legislation on matters the Government have yet to understand fully. As the Secretary of State indicated, the Government are still engaged in consultations on the details at this late stage. While we may enact this legislation, without confirmation that the EU will approve the UK’s approach, the Bill may ultimately prove unnecessary. It resembles legislation intended to influence an ongoing negotiation process, highlighting the Government’s lack of clarity in managing Brexit.

Labour Members are clear in their position: the UK should participate in the community licensing system to eliminate these avoidable trade obstacles and uncertainties. This legislation will empower the Government to implement a permit scheme allowing UK hauliers to be recognised throughout the EU. It will also set up a trailer registration scheme aligned with the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, which this Parliament ratified on 28 March 2018, thereby ensuring UK trailers are registered for operation on EU roads.",Powerlessness
"At that time, I submitted approximately 150 amendments and voted against the treaty on around 47 or 50 occasions. I must state that under no circumstances will I oppose this Bill. In fact, this marks the first time since 1986 that I have not voted against European legislation. The laws enacted in that year included the Single European Act. When I proposed the sovereignty amendment to that Act, I was not permitted to speak on it as it was not chosen for debate, which I found hard to accept then. Nevertheless, significant progress has been made since. A referendum was held, the proposal for which was approved by a six to one margin in this House. Additionally, a vote on the principle of this very Bill took place, passing by 498—500 including tellers—to 114.

Out of respect for other Members wishing to contribute, I will not elaborate on the details of the numerous new clauses. I do not believe that would be particularly helpful, as the key point is straightforward: these clauses would essentially create a veto power to overturn the outcome of the referendum. It is as clear as that.",Powerlessness
